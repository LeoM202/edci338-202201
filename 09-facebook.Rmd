✔️ how are users connected (e.g., on some platforms, you request a connection which needs to be accepted, but on others, you can follow anyone without them reciprocating)  
On Facebook, it’s possible to message anyone without having to send a friend request, but the normal way for people to connect is by sending a friend request. Users can follow pages of celebrities, artists, athletes, etc. without them having to follow back.   
✔️ can content be shared privately?  
Yes, there are multiple methods of sharing content privately with someone else on Facebook. The simplest way is by messaging them directly via Messenger and attaching files.

Sharing content posted by other users can also be done privately by sending them in Messenger and sharing to the personal feed privately.    
✔️ how is content shared?  
The main method for sharing content is by directly creating a post, which can be customized to be shown to different audiences.

•	Share to Feed  
•	Share to Your Story (Friends)

•	Share on a friend’s profile  
✔️ how does content go viral?  
One of the many ways to go viral is to post something that 	is related to the news, trending topics, or other major events that are happening in the real world. There will be many users who are searching and viewing posts about trending topics so there is a higher chance for a post to go viral if it’s socially relevant. In addition, most viral content is short and original. Users have a very short attention span and are often quickly scrolling through their timeline, so if a post catches someone’s attention, it’s very likely that it’s short and doesn’t copy other content.
