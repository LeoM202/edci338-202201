I am a PhD candidate studying assessment in online higher education and while reading your chapter in Re-imagining University Assessment in a Digital World  https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-41956-1_9, I encountered a reference to Transformative digital pedagogy: Reimagining connection, collaboration and design. This seems like a very important contribution to the literature but I have been unable to find it available online. Do you have an anticipated publication date for Developing undergraduate curriculum? Or, alternately, do you have a pre-print you might be able to forward?
