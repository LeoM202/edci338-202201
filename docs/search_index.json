The course utilizes blogs and other social media tools to develop networked literacy and learning networks that contribute to their professional practice in legal, safe, consensual and ethical ways. Course Developers Jesse Miller is the primary author of the materials in this course, and Colin Madland has revised some sections for the Spring 2022 cohort.

Click the link to the current week in the ToC to navigate to the current updates. Week One (Jan 10-16) Hello everyone and thank you for joining this course! My name is Colin Madland and I will be your instructor for this Spring 2022 cohort of EDCI 338, Social Media and Personalized Learning. I am a PhD candidate in the Educational Technology area of the Faculty of Education, where I am researching assessment in higher education. You can learn more about me and my research on my personal website and follow me on Twitter. I live and work in West Kelowna, BC, on the traditional, unceded, ancestral lands of the syilx people and I am grateful to be a guest here. When I am not working on my reasearch, or my day-job at another BC university, I really enjoy riding my bicycle, cooking all sorts of deliciousness on my grill, and hanging out with my family, which includes my wife, 2 two sons, 1 daughter-in-law, 1 daughter, 1 son-in-law, and 1 grandson. Some people might include the fur-bearing beasts (a dog and a cat) in the ‚Äòfamily‚Äô category, I know they certainly do! I‚Äôm going to be honest with you (hopefully that isn‚Äôt surprising‚Ä¶) and perhaps a bit vulnerable. I‚Äôm teaching EDCI338 for the first time this spring, and the course requires a significant investment in learning to use some technologies that you and I both may not be entirely familiar with. There aren‚Äôt really any good ways to think deeply about social media without actually engaging in social media. That can be really challenging, especially in the midst of the ongoing dispruption of our lives due to COVID-19. Disruption can take many forms, from being physically sick with COVID, to having family members and friends being affected, to losing jobs, and on and on. As a result, it can be really hard to focus on learning. So, I want you to understand from the very beginning that it is my *responsibility- in this course to do whatever it is that I can to support your success. üíØ My commitment to you‚Ä¶ I am committed to helping you achieve success in this course, and I trust you to contact me if you have questions or concerns. I hope you will find that you are welcome to approach me through whatever media I‚Äôve published. Admittedly, sometimes I miss notifcations, but that is not on you. I encourage you to be persistent if you haven‚Äôt heard a reply after a day or so. Getting Going During this first week, it will be important to start getting comfortable with a couple of the tools we will use for the course. There is a WordPress Setup and a GitHub Setup page with instructions for how to get started with those two tools. It will be important for you to get started with these tools as they will be critical to your work in the course. I have created a poll to help us decide on a weekly meeting time, but for this week, let‚Äôs meet at 9:00am Pacific time in Zoom at the link that I sent in the announcement from Brightspace Things To Do This Week ‚úîÔ∏è Read the syllabus, which will be posted in Brightspace early this week. ‚úîÔ∏è Sign up for a WordPress site. ‚úîÔ∏è Register for a GitHub account. ‚úîÔ∏è Visit the course repo on Github and create a Learner Profile issue (click Issues to get going‚Ä¶). ‚úîÔ∏è Sign up for hypothes.is and join the edci338 private group. ‚úîÔ∏è Annotate the Course Details and Assessment pages with your questions, comments, concerns, or other observations. Week One - Wednesday, Jan 12 It‚Äôs good to see you starting to register your WordPress sites, signing up for GitHub (BTW, don‚Äôt choose a paid plan!), and submitting your first issue to the ‚ÄòLearner Profiles‚Äô. You can see others who have submitted their issues as well at this link. While you are there, you can click on your own issue and add a label to align yourself with a Learning Pod. Screenshot of adding a label to a Github issue Also, in the EDCI338 repository that you created in your own account, please go to ‚ÄòSettings‚Äô, then ‚ÄòManage access‚Äô, and click the green ‚ÄòAdd people‚Äô button and add me as a collaborator to your repository. My GitHub username is cmadland. Since the Learner Profile issues you created in the course repo are public to the course, we will use your own private repository to track your work and have assessment conversations. Manage access to a repository in GitHub. ‚ú® ProTip It is perfectly normal to feel a bit overwhelmed or intimidated at the beginning of a course. EDCI338 has a bunch of front-loaded set up in technologies, and that always takes time. Please be patient with yourself and don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out if you need assistance. Week One Mini Update - Thursday GitHub In the spirit of learning together, I‚Äôve learned that I need to add you as collaborators on the course repository in order for you to use your Learner Profile issues to organize Learning Pods. Those of you who have created your Learner Profiles in GitHub as of 4:45pm on Thursday have been invited as collaborators and should see an email in your inbox with the invitation. Once you are a collaborator, you will be able to add the Learning Pod label to your profile.. Weekend Update 1 ‚Ä¶not that Weekend Update. Happy Saturday, at least I hope it is for you! For those of you in Victoria, stay away from the beaches for a bit until the tsunami warning is lifted! As of this morning, 19 of you have signed up for a GitHub account and created your Learner Profile in the course repository. Thank you for doing that. I know that everyone has different schedules, and in the past, most learners in my online classes do most of the work over the weekend. I anticipate a good number of you will be able to get going today and tomorrow. Just a reminder that you won‚Äôt be able to add the learning pod label to your learner profile until after I have added you as a collaborator in the repo. So far, I have added everyone who has submitted a Learner Profile issue, but there are a few of you who have not accepted that invitation. You can see the invitation if you sign in to Github and visit the course repo. There will be a blue notice towards the top of the page. As I mentioned previously, it really is important to get a good start becoming familiar with the technologies we will be using this term. Technology is a significant part of the *content- of this course, not just the medium for communication. If you are having challenges, please reach out to me as soon as possible! I‚Äôve published in Brightspace (look in the Content navigator) a link you can use to book an appointment. I encourage you to book as a learning pod or as an individual. Good to see several of you annotating the course book using Hypothes.is! While you are welcome to post publicly, I have created a private group for EDCI338 if you would prefer to use that. Check out ‚ÄòThings to do this week‚Äô. You will notice that there are several points in the course book where the text is highlighted, as below: hypothes.is annotations These are annotations using hypothes.is and you can access the tool by clicking the little arrow in the top right corner of the course book. hypothes.is access Then when the overlay opens, you‚Äôll be able to sign in or sign up to annotate the page. Hypothes.is is active throughout the book, so you can use it to ask questions about any page‚Ä¶even this one. If you do that, then answers to your questions will ba available to the whole class. Wins all around! üïê Class Meeting Times The class meeting time poll has closed and the most popular time (8 votes out of 14 people who voted) was 1:00pm on Fridays - Click to see a time Zone Converter . I usually like to meet earlier in the week, but I‚Äôm happy to fit the course schedule and rhythm to what works for most of you. Please let me know if you or your learning pod need to connect! I‚Äôm happy to make time for you. I‚Äôll end with this‚Ä¶ JodyVance on Twitter Direct Link Have a good weekend! Week Two (Jan 17-23) Thank you all for your work over this first week to get started with both WordPress and GitHub, and a bit of hypothes.is. Over the next couple days, I will get your blog links and feeds set up on the course hub so that you‚Äôll be able to find each others‚Äô thoughts and reflections. I have sent invitations to everyone who has submitted a Learner Profile issue on the course repository. If you haven‚Äôt yet completed that task, please do so as soon as possible this week to ensure you can join a Learning Pod. This week, we will begin looking at, thinking about, talking about and reflecting on what it means to be a participant in this ‚Äúgnarly hairball‚Äù, as danah boyd writes, of a digital culture we live in. We are interconnected in ways that we neither recognize nor give assent to, yet there are those who argue that we can use these same connections to derive significant relational value with other people. Social media is evolving tremendously rapidly (TikTok is only 5 years old and is already forcing YouTube and Instagram to change their approaches), and in many ways, careful thought about the implications of all this has not been at the forefront. We will think a bit about the importance of both building a network of allies and also the challenges of TMI (too much information). Week 2 Readings To get started, here are four articles and blog posts you should read: What is a Personal Learning Network? What are Personal Learning Networks? Understanding Personal Learning Networks Networked Privacy Please read these articles and then engage in some thinking in light of them during the following activities: Things To Do This Week ‚úîÔ∏è Read the four articles above. ‚úîÔ∏è Individually, use this Canva template, (or download the Venn Diagram image below, or draw your own) to think about how and why you participate in networked public spaces (the bottom-left circle), and how those ideas interact with your offline life (bottom-right circle), and with some other sphere of your life (top circle). You do not need to publish this, although you are welcome to, so the intent is to get you thinking about how the various circles of influence in your life interact, overlap, or maybe conflict. ‚úîÔ∏è Meet with your learning pod, ideally before the class meeting on Friday (1:00 Pacific Time) to discuss any questions you had about the readings or the Venn diagram activity. Feel free also to connect with each other about what social media tools you are particularly interested in. ‚úîÔ∏è Publish your first Wow and Wonder post on your WordPress blog. Make sure that your blog link is in your Learner Profile issue on the course repo and that you use the category edci338. ‚úîÔ∏è Meet in the course Zoom link (published in Brightspace) on Friday at 1:00 pm, Pacific time. Downloadable Venn Diagram Template Weekend Update 2 Welcome to the weekend! I trust that you will be productive, unplugged, connected to support, rested, or whatever you need in whatever measure you require. It was good to meet with about a third of you on Friday at 1:00 Pacific time. We were able to connect on some questions and get some more detail about using GitHub to manage your work in this course. Fortunately, I remembered to record the shareable parts of the meeting and post the recording to Brightspace under ‚ÄòZoom Recordings‚Äô. Feel free to have a look. There are a few of you who have joined from the waitlist in the last few days, so welcome to you! It will be important for you to review the updates from Week 1 in order to catch up to others in the class. Please let me know if you have questions! Hopefully, by the end of tomorrow (Sunday) you will have read the four articles listed under Week 2 Readings and met with your Learning Pod to discuss the readings, the Venn diagram activity, or any technical questions you might have so far. üí≠ Remember It is critical for you to stay in contact with either me or your Learning Pod or both if you are having difficulties! I recognize that there is a heavy technology lift at the beginning of this course, but I am confident that you can learn the workflow. It will be important for all of you to have completed all of the technology set-up tasks in GitHub and WordPress as we will be using GitHub more next week. Week Three (Jan 24 - 30) In Week 3, we are going to dive a bit more deeply into thinking about how you choose to present yourself in digital spaces, where you have control over that, and what you might do to regain control where it is lacking. Hopefully you recall the goals of the course, which include you being able to explain personalized learning and its relation to learning theory, and recognize that the Internet is not a neutral or equal space for everyone. You also should recall that your culminating post for this course, your Celebration of Learning, will require you to demonstrate how you have met each of the outcomes for the course. As such, it‚Äôs not too early to get started on your Celebration of Learning post as a draft on your site. Agency When you have the freedom and ability to take some specific action, it is often said that you have agency in that action. Unfortunately, in life, education, and social media, we sometimes lack agency. Compliance Tweet Link to Tweet Part of what I hope you will gain or develop in this course is a greater sense of agency over your interactions in digital spaces, whether they be networked and public, or not, and especially with respect to the technologies you might want or be required to use for your university education. Networked learning spaces have presented challenges for traditional models of university education, which has grown out of a long and very stable tradition that prioritizes lectures and the transmission of knowledge from the expert to the novice. Contrary to the transmission model, a networked model prioritizes the interactions between nodes in the network as the work of learning happens. In 2005, George Siemens wrote an influential article in which he outlined a vision of a learning theory for a networked time, which he called connectivism. One key argument in the theory of connectivism is that knowledge resides not only in individuals, but in the connections between individuals and that knowledge can be accessed through interactions between them. This is why this course is structured the way it is. By having you work in Learning Pods, rather than as individuals, and having you reference each other‚Äôs posts, it is intended that you will begin to realize the creation of a networked community. Further, by using GitHub and WordPress, which are both designed with features that enable and encourage lasting connections, rather than Brightspace, which is designed for short-term connections (at best), I hope that you, as a collective, will build a productive and supportive community of learners. Safety and Equity As a cis-gendered straight white male, I recognize that, if life were a video game (it‚Äôs not, and I don‚Äôt mean to trivialize the very real challenges we all face), I would be playing the game on the easiest level. I would have all the cheat codes, my challenges would be eminently attainable, and I would be able to breeze through the game with relative ease and comfort. Others, however, such as members of the LGBTQ+ community, Black or Indigenous people, disabled people, women and especially people who live at the intersection of more than one of those communities are all ‚Äòplaying‚Äô under far more challenging conditions, especially online. As such, many open source software communities have adopted community codes of conduct to ensure that all people have equitable opportunities to participate and contribute to the knowledge of the community. As the open education community has emerged from the open source software community, we too have adopted this practice. In the context of EDCI338, we are going to use this week to consider our own Code of Conduct. To do so, we will start to use the capabilities of GitHub a little more deeply. In GitHub, you can go to the ‚ÄòInsights‚Äô tab, and then choose ‚ÄòNetwork‚Äô, where you will see a Network graph, as below (it will be a bit different when you see it as I will have committed changes since then). Github Network Graph In the graph, you can see that there are two ‚Äòbranches‚Äô in the repository. A repository begins with only one branch, called main, but users can create branches, or copies, of the main branch in order to test features in the software, or ideas in the course, as it may be. You can see that this repository has two branches, the main branch (white, on the top), and a second branch called dev (green, on the bottom). The white line that drops down from main to dev on Jan 22 is when I merged the two branches by pushing changes I had made in main (the white dots) to dev so that the two branches were the same. I did this through a process called a pull request, or PR. By the time you see these instructions, I will have pushed changes from main to dev again, but dev will be ahead of main because I will have made changes on dev and started a pull request. The PR is the suggested addition of a Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct I am suggesting is based on (or forked from) other open source codes, but it doesn‚Äôt quite fit for application in a course (I think). Our primary task for this week will be to review the pull request and come to a decision (maybe a consensus, maybe not) about how to proceed. We might choose to revise the code, accept it as is, or create a completely new one‚Ä¶but we shouldn‚Äôt proceed without one. To see the pull request, sign in to Github and click the ‚ÄòPull requests‚Äô tab in the menu just below the title of the repository. You will see that there will be one open pull request for you to click on. Once in the PR interface, you will be able to scroll down the page to see an overview of the proposed changes. You can get a more detailed view if you click ‚ÄòFiles changed‚Äô, which will show you a split view of the old file on the left, with deletions in red, and the new file on the right, with additions in green. GitHub Split Screen View of Proposed Changes In the split view, you can hover over one of the lines in the view to see a blue square with a white + sign. Clicking this plus sign will allow you to make a comment about that particular line. On the ‚ÄòConversation‚Äô tab, there is space for a discussion of the PR as a whole at the bottom of the page. Caution The course book at cmadland.github.io/edci338-202201 is being served to the web from the main branch, so it will be important that you follow the instructions below carefully! GitHub Sign in to GitHub. Click ‚ÄòPull requests‚Äô and find the Code of Conduct PR. Click Files changed and read through the proposed Code of Conduct. Leave comments or questions at points that you think we need to clarify, delete, or maybe revise. I have assigned one Reviewer from each Learning Pod who will act as the official approver of the code for that particular learning pod, so make sure you come to some sort of agreement. Leave overall questions and comments on the discussion at the bottom of the Conversation tab. After we have discussed any of the issues you might find, I will merge the PR into the main branch and the code of conduct will come into effect. As always, please make sure you get in touch with me if you are having challenges! Things To Do This Week ‚úîÔ∏è All the things from weeks one and two. ‚úîÔ∏è Read the Siemens article. ‚úîÔ∏è Read and comment on the GitHub pull request as described above. ‚úîÔ∏è Publish your second Wow and Wonder on your blog. To clarify a bit‚Ä¶this should be a short post that describes one thing that struck you as important (Wow), and one question that you have (Wonder). Your Wow and wonder posts are required but not graded and they should serve as conversation starters in your Learning Pod meetings. ‚úîÔ∏è If you are not yet connected with a Learning Pod or showing on the Blog List page on the course hub, please contact me as soon as possible! Week Four (Jan 31 - Feb 6) Week four already! I trust you are finding your way in this course as we begin to dig more deeply into what it means to build and maintain a PLN and to interact well in social media environments. These first few weeks, we have been building connections in a few different ways: **Asynchronously*- as I publish and you read updates here on the course book site. **Asynchronously*- in Github as I provide some tasks for you and you work to complete those tasks. As of today, everyone should have an invitation to collaborate on the course repository, create a Learner Profile issue, add a label and comment on a pull request. You are welcome to use GitHub to create issues as a group and assign those to me. Doing this will allow the whole class to get answers to common questions rather than those answers being tied up in emails. I have created a ‚Äòquestion‚Äô label that you can add to these issues. **Synchronously*- as we meet in Zoom each Friday at 1:00 PM pacific time to discuss the course. Keep in mind, these meetings are optional and I (usually) record the important parts for your viewing pleasure. **Synchronously*- in your Learning Pods as you meet on your own time and schedule in a smaller group of people. The Learning Pods are intended to be a spot to ask questions of each other, review your wow and wonder posts, and will become your group for building the Major Project. Hopefully, you will begin to realize the beginnings of a PLN within the community of EDCI338. I am often asked by learners who they should follow on social media, and my first recommendation is always that they should follow their classmates as building a PLN among the people you go to school with can be tremendously powerful over the years after you graduate. This week, we look at some issues related to privacy and how that might influence how you choose to share your life and world with web tools. Many people have had the experience of having to click through an End User License Agreement (EULA) in order to use a service. Far- fewer people have actually read what that EULA actually says, and part of that is by design. Those Terms of Service- or EULAs are loooooong and filled with legal language, and much of the most important language is in ALL CAPS, which makes the text much more difficult to read. Digital Privacy It is second nature to most to take selfies and share them on Instagram, Snapchat, etc., but once you move into the role of an educator in either a public or private context, you must adhere to the laws set out by the B.C. Office of Information and Privacy Commissioner. Their office has put together guidelines for both public bodies and private bodies. TWU, as a private body is not held to the same standard as public bodies, but we should strive to meet the same standard. The guidelines for public bodies to better understand what the rules are is linked below and how to get consent is detailed on page 4 of the BC Cloud Computing Guidelines (PDF) and you can review the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act here.. TWU also has a privacy policy, available here. Each public body will have their own process (which may range from not allowing tools to pressure to integrate networked learning tools from outside of Canada), so it is important to understand your own setting and the law. You may find some administrators or staff breaking these rules or not aware of them. It is important for you to enter your field and uphold the law, regardless of the culture you enter. This does not mean that you do not engage online or outside of Canada. It means that if/when you do so, that you understand the steps, which are not much more complex than the consent you would get normally for going ‚Äúon the Internet,‚Äù as is described in most settings, but you must name the date consent is effective and, if applicable, the date it expires. It is important that you work with your school district on the consent process. You can see an example of how K-12 school districts are addressing access to cloud tools outside of Canada here (Coquitlam) and here plus here (Victoria). You must also name each tool individually. It cannot be ‚Äúblogging.‚Äù You must name WordPress.com or Blogger, etc. If you use Flipgrid, you must name Flipgrid. Consent must also be informed, so effort must be taken to ensure that those signing consent understand the implications ‚Äì that their data may leave Canada, how it may be harvested, and to know about the U.S. Patriot Act. One archived resource by the Canadian Treasury Board provides significant detailed information about the Patriot Act here. It is helpful to also review section 4(b) of the B.C. Digital Literacy Framework which is applicable K12 contexts but helpful for others. Additional resources can be found here: Privacy Education for Kids by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada Information Security Awareness by the BC Government MediaSmarts: Canada‚Äôs Centre for Digital and Media Literacy FIPPA, Privacy, and Consent Competencies Learners should ensure that they: - Are aware of the OIPC, FIPPA, and the Cloud Computing Guidelines and follow them - Understand what constitutes personal information - Understand that privacy online is a personal choice and must be respected - Understand if that you assume an ‚Äúeducator‚Äù hat, you have a duty for those under your care, their parents and families, and your colleagues with regard to their privacy and protection of personal information - Are aware that the Canadian federal government states that the chances are remote that the US Patriot Act will access personal information of Canadians, but recognizes that it is our responsibility to protect privacy preferences and to ensure that consent obtained is informed consent. Some families may be involved with restraining orders and need to be private for their safety, but the reasons for privacy may be preference. Either way, it is not our business as to the reasons for privacy preferences, but it is our responsibility to uphold preferences. - Understand how media moves through networks into US cloud-based services (e.g., back-ups on iTunes, syncing with Dropbox, messages with personal information is sent on Gmail, Google Docs, blog RSS subscriptions, etc.) - Understand that these acts do not prohibit participation in networked tools outside of Canada and many public bodies are in need of staff and leaders who model networked literacy and positive citizenship online for their community - Understand what appropriate consent looks like for public bodies and is aware of what alternative steps are to support learners when consent is not obtained. Residents and Visitors We will also explore a bit the idea of Visitors- and Residents- in digital spaces. You have likely heard that younger generations are digital natives, while older generations are *digital immigrants- indicating that younger people are totally at ease with technology since they grew up with it, while oder generations have difficulty with technology. I‚Äôd like to introduce you to a different way to conceptualize your relationship with digital media, and that is that you may be a visitor- in some web spaces and a resident- in others. Places on the web where you might be a visitor are those places where you, quite literally, visit, but importantly, don‚Äôt leave a public trace of your time there. You don‚Äôt spend any time interacting with people, but rather, you take a rather utilitarian approach by visiting a site, doing a thing, and leaving. Alternately, there are places and spaces on the web, where you- reside as a persona, where you interact, socialize, and leave traces of yourself online. For some, that may be Facebook, where you keep in touch with friends and family, or Twitter, or maybe it‚Äôs any number of social sites like Instagram, TikTok, SnapChat and others. The important distinction is that these are places where you connect with other people; where you are socially present*. At the same time, if we can imagine the visitor &lt;‚Äì&gt; resident continuum on a horizontal axis, there is also a personal &lt;‚Äì&gt; professional (or educational) continuum on a vertical axis, leading to 4 quadrants where you might situate your technology use. This video explains a process to help you think about where you reside on the web (7 mins). I‚Äôve shared my VR Diagram below‚Ä¶keep in mind that this diagram represents a set of tools that I have been using for a decade or more and that I have invested my career in educational technology. There is a lot here, but yours might look significantly different with only a few tools here and there. The main thing I would like to communicate with this idea of visitors and residents is for you to think about which technologies you use as a resident, and then to think about where your learners reside on the web. From there, we can begin to plan for tools we can use that afford us and our learners the opportunity to reside there. Visitor-Resident Diagram [OPTIONAL] If you don‚Äôt already, I encourage you to subscribe to this excellent podcast called *Teaching in Higher Ed- by Bonni Stachowiak, or, just take 47 minutes to listen to this episode in which Bonni interviews Dave White about the idea of visitors and residents. Digital Visitors and Residents, with David White - Teaching in Higher Ed Things To Do This Week ‚úîÔ∏è Complete the Privacy, Ethics &amp; Security in Digital Spaces Developing Awareness of Privacy quiz (not that kind of quiz‚Ä¶). ‚úîÔ∏è Read Visitors and Residents: A new typology for online engagement ‚úîÔ∏è Complete your own *Visitor/Resident- map and share and discuss it with your Learning Pod. You can use the tool that is provided here (DON‚ÄôT forget to screenshot it, or you‚Äôll lose it!), or use a different tool like Canva.com ‚úîÔ∏è Publish your third Wow and Wonder post based on your Visitor/Resident map and what you learned about privacy. ‚úîÔ∏è [Optional] Consider in your Wow and Wonder post what a potential employer might find based on your map if you applied for a job with them. ‚úîÔ∏è Set up a time with your Learning Pod to meet with me sometime this week. Please use the link published in BrightSpace, or submit an issue in Github. ‚úîÔ∏è Looking forward, your first Showcase post, based on one of your Wow and Wonder posts, is due at the end of next week (February 13). Major Project Update Good morning/afternoon/evening! I trust you are all well. This update will provide a mechanism to get you started on the Major Project. As a reminder, the major project is worth 40% of your final grade and will require some sustained effort over the second half of the course. I will be publishing details of the project as it unfolds on the Major Project page starting today. Week Five (February 7-13) Proximity creates empathy. ~Joel In last Friday‚Äôs class meeting (which is now posted in Brightspace), we talked about some of the forces at work in social media platforms and there was good conversation about hegemony, marginalization, and polarization as all being active forces, even though they are often opposing forces (hegemony means that everyone tends towards sameness, while polarization means that two or more groups of people become more and more different from the other groups). As we think about the idea of inclusion this week, I challenge you to consider who is included in your social media circles? Who do you follow or engage with? Who follows you? If the people you follow and the people who follow you are all the same people, and you all think alike, that can be comforting, but you may not be getting a complete picture of life. It can be challenging, yet important, to intentionally engage with people who are not like you. A great example of being intentional about engaging with people who are not like you is Mr.¬†Rogers when he invited Officer Clemmons to share his wading pool in 1969 at a time in the US when most swimming pools were still segregated. Mr.¬†Rogers set an example by inviting a Black man to join him in his wading pool. As you meet with your learning pod this week and talk about inclusion and diversity in your PLN, you might want to consider some of the following questions: How diverse is your existing PLN? In your PLN, are you learning from a variety of voices or are you the loudest in the room? Do you participate in a silo of information sharing (similar themes or wide range of interests)? How can you use a diverse PLN to broaden your views of inclusion? In your professional setting of choice, do you think inclusion is actively embraced? What is the learning outcome of your PLN and how are you ensuring your exposure to diversity and inclusion? How has your thinking about inclusion and PLN evolved after reviewing the videos and readings? Things To Do This Week ‚úîÔ∏è Read Pages 6-12 of One without the other: Stories of unity through diversity and inclusion by Shelley Moore and Leyton Schnellert. The link will require a UVic Library sign-in. ‚úîÔ∏è Watch Shelley Moore: Transforming Inclusive Education ‚úîÔ∏è Watch The Evolution of Inclusion ‚úîÔ∏è Watch a few more of Shelley Moore‚Äôs videos (most of them are 5 mins or less) or listen to some of her podcast interview (also available in her Youtube channel). Follow your interests on this. ‚úîÔ∏è Consider how Shelley uses various social media platforms to share her message and engage with the public. You might want to write a Wow of Wonder about this‚Ä¶ ‚úîÔ∏è Publish your Week 5 Wow and Wonder post. ‚úîÔ∏è Publish your first Showcase post. You can base your Showcase post on one of your own Wow and Wonder posts, someone else‚Äôs Wow and Wonder post, or a combination of both. You could even post about something not covered in a Wow and Wonder post. Check the details of the requirements of the post at the link above, and try to get it finished for Sunday, Feb 13. Please let me know if you are having difficulties publishing your post. ‚úîÔ∏è Sign Up to claim a social media platform with your Learning Pod. Instructions are on the Major Project page. Week Six (Feb‚ù§Ô∏è14 - 20) Showcase Posts Thank you to those who have sent links to their first showcase post. You don‚Äôt need to send a link, but it would be helpful if you add the ‚Äòshowcase‚Äô category to your showcase posts so I can easily find them and check to ensure that your blog is linked from the Learner Blogs page on the course hub. Also, please let me know if I need to update anything on that page. Some people have asked about commenting on other peoples‚Äô posts, and yes, you should comment on other peoples‚Äô posts. There are two ways that I recommend doing this. Include an inline link to someone‚Äôs post. For example, if I was wanting to comment on Shaafi‚Äôs Wow and Wonder Post 4, I would just select the text I want to link and click the ‚Äòhyperlink‚Äô tool to add the url of his site, https://shaafij.opened.ca/wow-and-wonder-post-4-week-5-feb-7-feb-13/. Paste the url for Shaafi‚Äôs post on its own line and without hyperlinking it. Normally, this will create an embedded preview in your post. The url will look like this: https://shaafij.opened.ca/wow-and-wonder-post-4-week-5-feb-7-feb-13/ And the preview will look like this in WordPress: Embedded Preview in WordPress Tracking and Feedback To aid in tracking your progress in the course, please complete the following steps in GitHub. In your own GitHub account, create a new private repository called ‚ÄòEDCI338‚Äô (some of you have already done this). Add me as a collaborator to your repository (some of you have also done this). Create an issue in your repository called ‚ÄòTracking‚Äô or something similar with the following copied and pasted into the Description area: - [ ] Wow and Wonder 1 - [ ] Wow and Wonder 2 - [ ] Wow and Wonder 3 - [ ] Wow and Wonder 4 - [ ] Wow and Wonder 5 - [ ] Wow and Wonder 6 - [ ] Wow and Wonder 7 - [ ] Wow and Wonder 8 - [ ] Wow and Wonder 9 - [ ] Showcase 1 - [ ] Showcase 2 - [ ] Major Project - [ ] Celebration of Learning Assign me to the issue. This will create a checklist on the issue that you and I can use to track your progress through the course. Since it is a private repo, it will also be the place where you and I have assessment conversations. Major Project Thank you also to those of you who have signed up for a social media platform to explore for the major project. Just waiting on Learning Pod 6 to sign up. Next steps will be published on the Major Project page tomorrow. Trust and your PLN A friend mentioned to me the other day that she didn‚Äôt know what was true on the internet anymore. It is hard, especially in the context of complex and highly emotionally charged issues (I‚Äôm sure you can think of something in Canada‚Ä¶), to sift through the massive amounts of information that you encounter, even if all that information were to be from trustworthy and reliable sources. Unfortunately, a huge amount of the information we encounter is from distinctly unreliable and untrustworthy sources. The power of social media to connect similar people to each other is both a strength when you are building a PLN, and a hazard when used to drive polarization. Renee DiResta on Twitter has published a good article on how misinformation campaigns are remarkably mundane in how they start and are shared. It really doesn‚Äôt require a sophisticated operation when everyday people will do it all alone. As you read DiResta‚Äôs article in The Atlantic, consider the questions from the syllabus: Building a reputation and trust in a connected culture can be difficult, how are you building a network of individuals who are dynamic, reliable, &amp; participatory. Are you leveraging healthy relationships from your PLN for growth? What strategies do you use to ensure that you aren‚Äôt an unwitting agent of what DiResta calls ‚Äòampliganda‚Äô? GitHub is a social platform focused around collaborating on coding or writing projects. In what ways have you connected with others in the class? Things To Do This Week ‚úîÔ∏è Compose and publish your first Showcase post, if you haven‚Äôt already. ‚úîÔ∏è Set up a GitHub repository of your own and invite me as a collaborator. ‚úîÔ∏è Create a tracking issue in your own repository and add me as an assignee. ‚úîÔ∏è Read It‚Äôs Not Misinformation. It‚Äôs Amplified Propaganda. ‚úîÔ∏è Publish Wow and Wonder #6 5 on your blog. ‚úîÔ∏è Continue planning for your Major Project. Week Seven (Feb 21-27) We are sliding into the back half of the course, and this week is a chance for you to recharge, catch up, get ahead, and just breathe a bit. This week, I am working my way through providing some comments on your first Showcase posts, so please make sure those are up to date and that you have created a course tracking issue in your own repository. If you are hoping to do some work on your Major project, I‚Äôve published some more instructions on the GitHub Setup page. I‚Äôve described how you can work in a fork of the course repository and also how to upload and add images to your pages (useful for the persona screenshots). I‚Äôm not going to bother you further until Monday, and we will not be meeting on Friday this week, but if you‚Äôd like to book a time to meet with me, I‚Äôm happy to do so. Thursday, Feb 24, 2022 üá®üá¶ üíî üá∫üá¶ Hello, I‚Äôm writing this with a heavy heart. The news out of Ukraine in the last weeks, and especially in the last 24 hours, is distressing, to say the least. As EDCI338 is a course specifically about social media and personal learning networks in education, it would be irresponsible to not mention that there will be a massive social media misinformation campaign coming out of Russia and their allies. Please take care of yourself and what you share. Please remember that there are supports available for you through the UVSS, and you are always welcome to book a time to meet with me to chat. üá®üá¶ üíî üá∫üá¶ Week Eight (Feb 28 - Mar 6) ‚ú® Note I‚Äôve just noticed that the numbering in the syllabus is a bit different from this site. This is Week 8 of the course, and Class 7 in the syllabus. Sorry for the confusion. Prior to reading week, we read about the idea of ampliganda, a term coined by Renee DiResta that captures the fact that misinformation gets amplified in social media and that we sometimes unwittingly become the vector by which it spreads. Little did I know that we would, in the following week, observe a misinformation campaign in such obvious clarity. The Russian embassy in Ottawa posted this tweet to their official account yesterday: Russian Misinformation Campaign I posted a screenshot here so that I‚Äôm not linking to it, which would cause it to be shared more widely. As it is, you can see the tweet was Retweeted 641 times (thie image itself was RT‚Äôd 2600 times) as I‚Äôm writing this. It is extremely difficult to stop ampliganda because of how social media works by encouraging sharing and creating more and more connections. I encourage you to read and follow the advice in this post from Mike Caulfield that covers four ‚Äòmoves‚Äô to help you sort through misinformation. You can also find tools in this Twitter Moment. Surveillance This week, in a bit of a departure from the syllabus, I‚Äôd like you to read, discuss, think, and write about how social media tools of various different types are used to surveil us for profit. In this case, we will take a bit more expansive view of what ‚Äòsocial media‚Äô is in that some of the platforms that come up may not be considered social media by many people, but they rely on the same logic of gathering huge amounts of data from people, aggregating it, and analyzing it to draw inferences based on what the programers determine to be normal. The first platform that falls into this category is TurnItIn (TII), which you may recognize as the tool many universities use to, presumably, detect plagiarism (Note: TII cannot detect plagiarism, and it never has). TII is very much a social platform as it relies on being able to compare the work that you submit to it‚Äôs platform to the work that others submit and the work that others have published on the web. In my other job, where I am the administrator for Moodle, I receive emails from instructors in other universities requesting access to student work that has been flagged as being similar (I always deny their request as that would be an invasion of student privacy and violation of their copyright.) So, the social aspect of TII is completely hidden from you, but it is the key driver of growth for TII. How does TII profit from your data? Good question. Jim Luke, an economics prof in the US, has some thoughts on that. Another similar platform is Proctorio, whose business model is to convince universities that they need to pay Proctorio huge sums of money to require students to install spyware on their computer in order to prevent catch students cheating in exams. This week, you‚Äôll watch some short films on the topic of surveillance in education and society to help you think through the impacts of what Shoshana Zuboff calls surveillance capitalism. Things To Do This Week ‚úîÔ∏è Make sure you have received my feedback on your first showcase post. Check in your GitHub repository and/or your email for a notification from GitHub. Please be in touch as soon as possible if you haven‚Äôt heard from me. ‚úîÔ∏è Read the posts and articles linked above and scan through the Twitter Moment for resources that you can use. Keep in mind that some resources will be paywalled, don‚Äôt worry about trying to access those, just keep scrolling. ‚úîÔ∏è Watch #tresdancing from the Screeing Surveillance series of short films from Queen‚Äôs University. ‚úîÔ∏è Watch at least one other of the short films from Screening Surveillance. ‚úîÔ∏è Meet and Discuss with your learning pod the topic of surveillance in social media, both the platforms I mention above and the platform that you have chosen for your Major Project. ‚úîÔ∏è Publish Wow and Wonder 6 on your blog based on this week‚Äôs activities. ‚úîÔ∏è Begin collaboratively composing and publishing information about your chosen social media platform for the Major Project. You should have one person in your learning pod who has forked the course repository, and the rest of the people in your learning pod who have forked the fork (fork-ception). You should have published your personas, and this week you can start gathering descriptive data about your platform. I‚Äôll publish more specific details about what to publish today or tomorrow. Week Nine (Mar 7-13) And just like that, we have 4 weeks left in the course! Just a reminder that week nine here corresponds to class 8 on the syllabus HOWEVER we are going to skip class 8 for now and jump to class 9, PLN in Education. I‚Äôm looking at the syllabus and thinking that things have piled up here at the end of the course, so I‚Äôd like to propose that we make an adjustment by dropping the Showcase Post #2 and moving the weight of that assignment to the first showcase, the Major Project, and the Celebration of Learning post. I have created an issue in the course repository where we can discuss this proposal. Please add your voice there. For the remaining four weeks of the course, there will be less of an emphasis on new content and a greater emphasis on you building your components of the Major Project. With that in mind, we turn to one last major topic in the course, and that is thinking about your PLN in the context of education, either formally, such as in EDCI338 or another accredited course experience, or informally, as in when you need to learn how to drive a manual transmission car, or juggle, or cook. Alec Couros is a professor at the University of Regina in Saskatchewan and he is one of the pioneers of the type of open course that EDCI338 emulates in some ways. Couros wrote a book chapter called Developing Personal Learning Networks for Open and Social Learning in which he describes a graduate course he taught in 2008. EC&amp;I 831 had 20 registered participants, but over 200 participants who followed along simply to engage in the community and connect with each other. As you read Couros‚Äô account, there are some things that you may be interested to notice. First are the similarities between the requirements for EDCI338 and EC&amp;I831 in terms of reflective practice combined with collaborative work and using technology. Also, please notice that many of the technological tools Couros writes about are no longer even in existence. Their main course site, wikispaces.com, went out of business several years ago, leaving users very much in a lurch to find alternate homes for their content. Elluminate used to be one of the premiere web conferencing tools, but was purchased by Blackboard, the LMS company, and is now deprecated in favour of Blackboard Collaborate Ultra. Ning.com used to be free, but is now a paid service, so no longer popular for educators. The list goes on. One significant idea that I want you to remember in this, and a reason that I am using GitHub, is that tech platforms come and go, and with them, go their proprietary formats. If a proprietary format can no longer be read, then it is useless. If the platform disappears, your content disappears. Contrary to that, with GitHub, since it reads plain text files, you can take your content with you and deploy it in another platform with only some relatively minor modifications. This idea of being able to take your content with you and deploy it in a different system is called inter-operability, and it is a major concern in the social media landscape today. Think about how challenging it is to download an image from Instagram, or a clip from TikTok without one of those third-party apps (it‚Äôs not just me, is it?). This is evidence that these platforms are not inter-operable; you can‚Äôt easily use content from one platform in a different platform. Also, as you read Couros‚Äô chapter, consider whether or not you have experienced a PLN either within your Learning Pod, or within the course. Have you been able to build trusting relationships within the class? Why or why not? Things To Do This Week ‚úîÔ∏è Read chapter 6, Developing Personal Learning Networks for Open and Social Learning (PDF download, sorry) in Emerging Technologies in Distance Education. ‚úîÔ∏è Publish your seventh Wow and Wonder post and discuss your posts in your Learning Pods. ‚úîÔ∏è Follow several educators in your chosen social media platform (whatever that looks like in your platform). Then, to find more educators, see who they follow and follow them. Feel free to use your persona‚Äôs accounts as well as, or instead of, your own. ‚úîÔ∏è Begin drafting and composing your Celebration of Learning post so it isn‚Äôt a panic in the last week. ‚úîÔ∏è Continue Building your Major Project page. By the end of this week (Mar 13), you should have a substantial pull request to send your work from your Learning Pod‚Äôs repo to the main course repo. Please be in touch if you are confused about how to do this!! Do not wait! It is up to you to reach out for assistance.

Ultimately, you need to demonstrate to me that you have met the outcomes listed on the syllabus. In a course about social media and personal learning networks, that means you will have to demonstrate to me in your activities and in your reflections on those activities that you have, in one way or another, met the intended outcomes. Doing your work with that in mind will absolutely help you perform in the course. It also means that you will have to make your personal learning network interactions visible to me and to your fellow learners in the course. The way to do that is to tag your work in whatever platform you are interacting with edci338. The work you do will happen in two primary locations and some other secondary locations. Please see the Course Toolset for more details. The fundamental and core task in this course is for you to build and reflect on a Personal Learning Network (PLN) using modern networked tools. Your PLN will likely end up with two nodes by the time the course is complete. One node will be the network we build within this community of learners, while the other node (or maybe more) will be the professional connections you make outside the course. Hopefully, both nodes will persist beyond the end of the course, which is why it is critical that the work you do is NOT locked up in an institutional Learning Management System (LMS; Brightspace is the UVic LMS). Building Community Support This is an asynchronous online course, meaning that we don‚Äôt have any specific required meeting times. This can be a significant advantage for those who unable to meet at a particular time on in a particular place, but it can also contribute to challenges completing the coursework for those who prefer to work in more social contexts. We seek to strike a balance between learners working in isolation, and requiring on-campus meetings. To do this, there are three critical structures in the course: learning pods, weekly meetings, and assessment meetings with me. Learning Pods You will be provided a link to a password-protected page where you can sign up for a learning pod, which is a group of 3-4 learners who meet together regularly (ideally weekly) at a time that works for them. This time should be used to review the course materials and any questions that learners might have, and also to plan and organize work on the course assignments. Learning pods are intended to be your first line of support during the course. Weekly Meetings We will determine a time during the week that works for as many people as possible for a 1-hour meeting time with me. This meeting will not be required, but it is strongly recommended that you attend as many of these meetings as you are able. This will be a time to discuss the week‚Äôs readings, clarify questions about both the content and the logistics (what is due when and where) of the course. Assessment Meetings Each learning pod will be required to meet with me at least twice during the course. The first time will be within the first two weeks to ensure that you have been able to get set up with all the required tools and connected with a learning pod. The second required time will be prior to reading week to ensure that you are on track for the Major Project. Learning pods are also encouraged to book meeting times with me as needed. Community Contributions and Connections (30%) Throughout the course, you will be required to reflect on the work you are doing in relation to the topics of that particular week. This reflection will be in the form of blog posts on your own blog (either on opened.ca, or another blogging platform) and they will be due throughout the course. There are 8 prompts for you in the course and you will be required to respond to each of those. You will choose 2 to be assessed for grading as showcase posts (15% each for a total of 30%). Your 2 showcase posts will be polished for publication on your blog and should reflect a professional voice. Post Prompts (Reviewed in your Learning Pods) Your posts in response to each of the prompts will be in the form of one ‚ÄòWow‚Äô and one ‚ÄòWonder‚Äô. A Wow is anything from the week that caught your interest from the readings, videos, tasks, your PLN, or one of your fellow learners‚Äô posts. It should be something that you haven‚Äôt thought of before or maybe that you have changed your thinking about. A Wonder is something that you have a question about from the same sources. It might be something you thought wasn‚Äôt explained clearly, something that is counter-intuitive, doesn‚Äôt make sense, is muddy, or simply something you want to investigate further. Your Wow and Wonder posts can be brief (100-150 words) and in point form, but they must include a hyperlink to the artifact you are writing about and a brief reflection on why you chose that Wow or Wonder. Showcase Posts (2 @ 15% each) You will choose 2 of your Wow and Wonder posts and expand and polish them to be about 500 words. You should reference course artifacts and find resources not listed in the syllabus to inform and support your thinking about your Wows and Wonders. Set a goal for yourself of linking to at least 2 other learners in each showcase post. You are encouraged to diversify your interaction and reading of other learners in the community. You should find that these interactions lead to increased traffic on your own blog, which will provide opportunities to have your thinking supported, questions answered, and possibly new connections made. It is recommended that you comment on others‚Äô posts by including a link in your own post to the post you are commenting on. This will create a ‚Äòtrackback‚Äô on the original post, which is just like a comment. Make sure you check the comments on your own site because you will have to approve them before they are visible. You will see a notification in the side menu of WordPress when you have comments that need to be approved. Each Showcase post should: be about 500 words in length, include a featured image, include hyperlinks to relevant course materials and activities, include commentary on and hyperlinks to other EDCI338 learners‚Äô posts, a list of references including hyperlinks to cited work (use the style you are accustomed to) Suggested Prompts for Comments Please remember that these blogs are shared publicly, as are your comments. It is important to use your comments as a way to provide supportive, constructive feedback, to initiate a conversation, or to share connections. Keep your language positive, offer suggestions, and focus on the content of the blog post - discourse is encouraged. Examples of positive engagement include: My new thinking after reading your post is‚Ä¶ I agree with the idea of‚Ä¶ because‚Ä¶ I am wondering if you have read this article/website/book (share a resource link) I noticed that our thinking differs in this way‚Ä¶ A connection I made between your work and‚Ä¶is‚Ä¶ I really liked how you explained‚Ä¶and I am wondering if you can tell me more about‚Ä¶ Something I am wondering after reading your post is‚Ä¶ Major Project (40%) You will be working on the major project throughout the course and in collaboration with both a learning pod and also with the whole class. The end result of this work will be a polished e-book of resources for educators who want to learn about social media and building a PLN. For this project, you will be working in Learning Pods, a group of 3-4 learners working together to help each other succeed. Each Learning Pod will be responsible for researching and publishing resources about one social media tool that educators might use in their teaching. There is a preliminary list of tools on the toolset page. The platform we will use to create the resource will be GitHub, a tool specifically designed to enable remote teams to collaborate on complex projects. Git, the software that enables GitHub, was designed to aid the development of the Linux operating system. We will spend some time early in the course becoming familiar with GitHub and the terminology it uses. While this may sound intimidating, it is well within your capabilities to learn to use it. One thing you need to know about GitHub is that it makes everyone‚Äôs contributions visible to the whole community. We will all be working in the same space, and everyone in the class will be able to see what everyone else has contributed. Project Details You will work in your learning pods to complete the major project, which will be to create an online resource for educators wishing to learn about using social media tools to build a Personal Learning Network. Each Learning Pod will contribute an in-depth analysis of one networking tool that might be used in educational settings. The structure of each page in the resource will follow the topics and structure of the course, so you will be working on completing the major project as you progress through the course. Celebration of Learning (30%) Your final task in the course will be to tell me what you have learned. This will be one final post published on your blog in which you reflect on each of the course outcomes and how your work in the course contributed to meeting those outcomes. Your reflection must include references and hyperlinks to: - your own work in the course and an explanation of how your thinking was formed, - your colleagues‚Äô work in the course and an explanation of how their work informed your thinking, - course materials, including articles, videos, interviews, social media artifacts, etc. ‚ú® ProTip I STRONGLY recommend that you create this post as a draft at the beginning of the course and add to it throughout the course as we progress. It will be much more difficult to complete this post if you leave it until the end. An easy way to help yourself manage this is to create a set of outcome categories on your blog (outcome1, outcome2, etc) and apply those categories to the posts that meet those outcomes. Grading Standards Click here to read about the SOLO Taxonomy. "],["course-toolset.html", "Course Toolset Primary Tools Secondary Tools", " Course Toolset We will use a variety of tools in this course, as you might expect in a course about personal learning networks and using social media in education. One of the primary reasons for that is to allow opportunity for you to make your learning visible and to share it with the community, whatever that might look like for you. I recognize that you may be coming to this course for a variety of reasons, including as an elective for your Teacher Education program, but also as an elective in another program, for your own personal learning, or maybe because you heard about the series of courses that edtechuvic offers. Regardless of your reason for being here, you are welcome! It is important to note that we will be using multiple tools in this course, and I am aware that this can create challenges for people. While it is up to you to ensure that you have proper access to the information that you need, please ensure that you reach out to me if you have questions. These tools are central to the course content and it is literally my job to help you with this! Primary Tools These primary tools form the backbone of EDCI338 and are the core creation tools we will use. WordPress Instructions related to WordPress will appear inside blocks of this colour. WordPress will be our hub for EDCI338. The course hub is where I will post updates throughout the course and you are strongly encouraged to subscribe to receive notifications of updates using an email address that you often check. Additionally, you will sign up for and create your own WordPress site. It is on this site that you will publish your reflections on your work through the course. We have provided instructions for how to get set up on opened.ca. You may already have an ___.opened.ca website that you created for another EDCI course and you may use that one by simply adding an edci338 category to your posts. You may also use your own site through WordPress.com or another blogging tool, as long as the site publishes an RSS feed. The main caveat is that my ability to help troubleshoot your site may be more limited if you aren‚Äôt on opened.ca. GitHub A significant part of the work you will do for EDCI338 will be in the context of creating content using a collaborative tool. GitHub is a tool designed for the collaborative creation of software, but it can also be used for people looking to collaborate on text and multi-media documents. While GitHub may be unfamiliar to some of you, the workflow is not difficult to learn. - sign up with your uvic.ca email address to get a free upgrade. Secondary Tools The secondary tools are more topical in the course and will be the subjects of our explorations. Instructions related to secondary tools will appear inside blocks of this colour. An RSS Reader {-} There are numerous feed readers available on the web, but two that I recommend are Feedly and, my personal choice, Inoreader. Both offer free plans with ‚Äòpro‚Äô upgrades, but the free plans should be more than adequate for this course. Feed readers allow users to aggregate updates, or feeds, from various sources, such as blogs or news websites. Unfortunately, the free tier of most feed readers doesn‚Äôt include the ability to subscribe to social media feeds, such as Twitter or TikTok. A feed reader can help you stay in touch with others in this course as well as receive notifications on my updates.

"],["github-setup.html", "GitHub Setup Markdown Fork, Pull, Fetch Adding an Image", " GitHub Setup Github will be the main location of our collaborative work in EDCI338. While Github was created for teams to collaborate on coding projects, it can also be used for many other projects. Some of the language around interacting with Github might be new to you, but that is ok, it will seem foreign at first, but the whole point of you taking this course is to learn new skills, right?! I‚Äôm here to help. The first thing you might notice is that there are some weird punctuation marks in the raw text in Github. That is called Markdown, which is a way to tell web-browsers how to style text. The basics are super easy to learn, and they map pretty well to what you might do in a word processor. For example, in MS Word, if you want to indicate a heading, you put your cursor in the text, and choose the Heading 2 style. You can do the same thing in Markdown by simply adding two hashtags and a space before the text, like this‚Ä¶ ## Markdown Which shows up on the page like this‚Ä¶ Markdown Each heading level uses the corresponding number of hashtags. Heading levels # Heading 1 ## Heading 2 ### Heading 3 #### Heading 4 ##### Heading 5 ###### Heading 6 Styling text You can also style text as italics *italics*, or bold **bold**, and you can also stack codes so bold italics ***bold italics***. Lists You can quickly and easily create an unordered list (bullets) with either a *, or a - followed by a space‚Ä¶ - berries - fruit - vegetables berries fruit vegetables You can create an ordered list by doing the same with a number and a .‚Ä¶ 1. Cycling 2. Running 3. Rowing Cycling Running Rowing Hyperlinks Put the text you want to display between square brackets, followed by the URL in parentheses [Put the text you want to display between square brackets, followed by the URL in parentheses](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci338) Images Images use the same syntax as hyperlinks, except they use an ! at the beginning, so‚Ä¶ ![Ellie with a cactus in her nose](assets/w1/poor-ellie.jpg) renders to Ellie with a cactus in her nose The difference with images is that you need to make sure the image is physically in the same repository that you are working in. In this case, the image is in the assets/w1/ folder. Things To Do in GitHub ‚úîÔ∏è Register for an account. ‚úîÔ∏è Create a new repository called EDCI338 ‚úîÔ∏è choose ‚ÄòPrivate‚Äô in the visibility settings (step 4, above) ‚úîÔ∏è Go to the course repository ‚úîÔ∏è Click Issues, then New Issue, then Get Started to create a Learner Profile for yourself. ‚úîÔ∏è If you know who will be in your learning pod, please add the Label to your issue that corresponds with your Learning Pod, otherwise, you can just add a label that has fewer than 4 members already. Fork, Pull, Fetch Sometimes the lingo of Git and GitHub can be a bit confusing, and perhaps like there are too many steps to just save some work. Admittedly, the language does take some time to learn, but it is rather intuitive once it is explained. The way that we are using GitHub (editing content directly within the web interface) isn‚Äôt the typical workflow, but that is ok. You should think of the course repository, which I own, as the remote, meaning that it is the content stored on the web, not on your computer (which would be local). When you edit on GitHub, you have limited permission to make changes in that you can‚Äôt make changes directly to my repository, but rather, you need to propose changes, and ask me for permission to change the repository. You do this by creating a pull request, which is just you telling me that you have some proposed changes and asking me to pull them from your proposal into the repository. Creating a pull request like this is what allows us to collaborate on the repository without your changes overwriting the course materials. This creates a fair amount of friction in that you need to wait for me to approve your changes before you can proceed. There is a way around this though, and that is by creating a fork of the repository (several of you did this at the beginning of the course already). A fork is an exact copy of a repository at a particular point in time. So if you forked the course repo on January 14, you would have a copy of the course materials as they were on Jan 14, but there would be a notification that your copy is x number of commits behind the remote repo. If that is the case, you can catch up to the remote by clicking fetch upstream, then fetch and merge. Fetch and Merge in Github Once you have a fork of the repository, you can make all the changes you want to your copy of the repository, then, when you are ready, you can open a pull request to have your changes merged into the main repo. ‚ú® ProTip For EDCI338, you need to have ONE person from your learning pod with an up-to-date fork of the course repository, then the other people in the learning pod should fork that repository. for example, the main repo is at cmadland/edci-202201, and Chloe has a fork at chloelyh/edci338-202201, so each of Chloe‚Äôs learning pod members should fork chloelyh/edci338-202201. With this setup, each learning pod can be working on their own repo without any need for me to approve changes before they continue. then, when they are ready, each learning pod member opens a pull request with Chloe, who merges all the changes into her repo, then opens a pull request with my repo to merge all of those changes to the main. This way, each individual learning pod members‚Äô contributions are recorded along with the learning pod as a whole. Adding an Image Adding images requires a little bit of work, as it isn‚Äôt drag and drop like you might be used to in your word processor. That said, it‚Äôs relatively straightforward. Add a folder In your repository, click the assets folder, then click Add file, then Create new file. Add a new file in GitHub This step will only create a new folder for you; you won‚Äôt add the image yet. Enter the name of your social media platform and then type a / (this step is important!!) and then type a random word like sample or placeholder. Give the folder a title Give the file a name. Commit and push your changes. Since this is your own repo, you will be able to commit directly to the main branch of your repository. Commit your changes You will then have a folder with the title of your social media platform inside the assets folder. There will be one file inside your platform folder, but you can ignore or delete it. Prepare your image file. Your image should be relatively small (under 1MB), so if it is too large, you can compress it with tinypng.com. The filename should be as simple as possible; one word is ideal. Don‚Äôt use any capital letters, punctuation, spaces, or symbols other than - or _. Upload your image. Click into your new folder, and click Add file, then Upload files. You can either drag and drop your image, or navigate to the file on your computer. Commit your changes. Here is an instructional video highlighting this process See the instructions above for adding an image to a page.

Though there are no official statistics on the average age of Discord users, one site estimates that majority of users are adults between 30-33 years of age 1. Though the creators of Discord made the platform with no targeted users in mind, the platform continues to be widely used by people who play video games as an efficient way to message and chat to others. Discord servers may also be created to connect users with similar interest or hobbies, chats with friends and family, and for educational or professional purposes [2]. Political leaning of users is varied, and there are many existing servers and communities for users of all positions of the political spectrum. Individuals do not necessarily need an account to use Discord. One can access servers or communities through a shared link, and are only asked to create a username and agree to Discord‚Äôs terms of service. However, if one does not create an account in that session their activity will not be saved [3]. Discord contains both public and private servers. Private servers are accessed only by an invitation from a member of the group, and are typically used to chat with friends or family members. On the other hand, public servers may be accessed by anyone and are typically larger communities for those with similar interests. Discord also has a friend request feature, where one can accept or reject friend requests. Content Content Sharing One of the best-known abilities of Discord is group-chatting, which allows content to be shared among individuals in multiple ways. * Server The primary way of how discord organizes group chats is through establishing servers, which are chat rooms where users can join to engage each other. Servers can be created for any purpose and can hold up to 500,000 members [5]. While some servers are public for anyone to join, most servers created are private and can only be joined through invitations. Within a created server, content can be shared under two types of channels: text and voice. Text channels enable the sharing of textual information as well as images, emojis, and files. Voice channels are like phone booths where members can engage in voice or video conversations. * Group direct messages (DMs) Another way of how content can be shared on discord is through direct messages. Similar to DM between individuals, group DMs can be used to communicate between multiple members. This content stays only between the members in the group, and both text and voice messages can be delivered within an established group. Private Sharing Direct Messages (DMs) On Discord, DMs can be sent between different users and allow users to engage in one-on-one conversations. These conversations will not be seen on a public chat server or any members that are not part of the conversation [4]. Private server channels Both text and voice channels within a server can be created as private. This means that only those with permission can access the content within the channel. This can be an effective way to establish conversations between group leaders or administrative personnel. Viral Content There are essentially two ways for content to go viral or gain more attention. * Discord Nitro Although discord is a software that is free to download and use, the software offers a subscription service with Discord Nitro. This paid service offers a range of extended features, such as better customizable emojis and upload size for file sharing, but more importantly, it allows a server to be boosted. A boosted server will have both ‚Äã‚Äãperformance and cosmetic improvements such as more emoji slots and better audio and screen sharing quality [6]. These features can help to create high quality and outstanding servers on discord and can largely improve the user experience within the server, which in turn helps to promote any content that is being distributed on the server and attract * Expanding/advertising the server Another way of spreading the content or the server is through advertising the server itself. This is a very straightforward way of promoting the popularity or awareness of any content on a server. Spreading the server invitation on other social media platforms can be an effective way. Websites, such as top.gg and Discord.me, ranks servers based on different categories or popularity and allows the public to join the server directly. Another way that can help attract more users is diversifying the members within the server community. Attracting people from various backgrounds can promote a higher level of networking across different fields and the potential for the content to spread across wider areas. Company/Business Details Co-founders, Jason Citron and Stan Vishnevskiy developed Discord in 2012 and finally launched it in 2015. Since then, Discord has remained a private company, as it is not listed on any stock exchanges. As a result of Discord being a private company, it is not clearly known what sized stake each investor has. However, from when the company first launched, overall ownership has been split between the two co-founders and several other venture capitalist firms [9]. Some of the major investors that helped to finance Discord include [10]: Dragoneer Investment Group - Led the most recent funding round of $500 million in Semptember 2021. Sony Interactive Entertainment - Lead investor during secondary market funding in 2021 Greenoaks - Lead investor for a $100 million Series H funding round in 2020 and one in 2018 with $150 million funding. Index Ventures - Led funding rounds in 2020 with $100 million and 2018 with $150 million in funding. Greylock - Lead investor for the earliest funding rounds in 2016 Spark Capital - Partnered with Greylock as lead investors in 2016, funding $20 million. Discord collected various rounds of funding over the years and has had many investors to help contribute to the success of the company. Discord over the last two years has been valued at $3.5 billion in the year 2020 and $7 billion in 2021 [12]. Today, Discord‚Äôs estimated value currently stands at approximately $15 billion as a result of the funding by Dragoneer Investment Group [11]. As Discord does not use ads like many other social platforms, there begs the question of how does Discord bring in revenue? Discord earns revenue in various ways. Firstly, their main source of revenue comes from the subscription packages that they offer. The premium subscription, Discord Nitro, costs a user $9.99 a month or $99.99 a year, whereas their lower price subscription, Nitro Classic, costs $4.99 a month and $49.99 a year [7]. According to Discords metrics, there are about 150 million active monthly users monthly [8]. Following this they also make money through a 10% cut of titles that game developers sell through verified servers [7]. Notably, Discord also generates a minor amount of profit from the stickers and merchandise they sell, such as branded tee-shirts, hoodies, socks, and more. While there has been no revenue report for 2021, their 2020 revenue was reported to be approximately $130 million [12].

We will add to the project week-by-week and will act as each others‚Äô peer reviewers as we go so that the final result after the next 6 weeks is a user-friendly resource for others seeking information on particular social media platforms. Sign up for a Social Media Platform The first thing we need to do is to have each Learning Pod ‚Äòsign up‚Äô to a particular social media platform. This will be the platform that you use as the basis for your Final Project. The structure of the project is such that we can only have one group working on a particular social media platform, so it will be first-come-first-served for the sign up. GitHub will track the specific time that issues are added and will display the issues in reverse chronological order on the issues page. ‚ú® Follow These Steps‚Ä¶ ‚úîÔ∏è Create an new issue in the Course Repository (not a learner profile, you‚Äôll have to click the ‚ÄòOpen a blank issue‚Äô link) and add: ‚úîÔ∏è each of your Learning Pod members as assignees ‚úîÔ∏è me as an assignee ‚úîÔ∏è your Learning Pod label ‚úîÔ∏è a new label identifying the social media platform you are signing up for (make sure it isn‚Äôt already taken). ‚úîÔ∏è the ‚ÄòEDCI338 Major Project‚Äô project. Looks like I will have to do that bit. There are obviously many social network platforms to choose from, some of which are more popular than others. If another pod claims a platform that your pod was hoping to claim, in addition to adding a new label for your second-choice platform, add a comment in your issue and a link to the issue that has already claimed your first-choice platform. We might be able to differentiate your projects enough to allow two groups to explore a single platform. No promises. Create Personas Now that you have chosen a social media platform, it‚Äôs time to get organized. The issue that you created in step 1 will become the main home for conversations about your project. Please edit your issue and add the following checklist to the ‚ÄòDescription‚Äô section‚Ä¶ - [ ] Personas - [ ] Demographic Information - [ ] Digital Identity - [ ] Privacy and Surveillance - [ ] Access and Inclusion - [ ] Trust and Misinformation - [ ] Public Discourse - [ ] Education - [ ] Media Literacy - [ ] Reflections You first task is to create as many Personas as there are members in your Learning Pod. The reason for this is to allow everyone the opportunity to create accounts on your platform of choice from behind the curtain of an imagined persona. There are some people who cannot and should not be public on the web, and this is a way to provide some anonymity. You need not engage in research of a typical user on your chosen platform, but simply imagine the characteristics of someone who might want to engage on the platform. I encourage you to imagine a diversity of personas with various characteristics and backgrounds. You can certainly draw from your own experiences as inspiration for your personas, but you are not required to do so. You are welcome to use xtensio.com to create your personas, but other tools like Canva.com may be useful as well. You can use an image from generated.photos/, which generates face images through AI, meaning you don‚Äôt have to worry about having to ask someone for permission to use their photo. ‚úîÔ∏è Upload your personas as images to a folder with the name of your social media platform inside the ‚Äòassets‚Äô folder in the course book. ‚úîÔ∏è Embed your persona images on your platform page in the course book. Demographics At this point, you should have ONE person in your learning pod who has forked the course repository and the other members of your learning pod who have been added as collaborators to that fork. GitHub Fork Set-up for each Learning Pod Each Learning Pod will first contribute to their fork of the course repository owned by one of the pod members. Once you have enough content drafted and you‚Äôd like to share with the rest of the class, you can open a ‚ÄòPull Request‚Äô in GitHub to send your contributions over to the main course repo. I will be automatically notified and will need to approve these pull requests, so maybe aim for 1 pull request per learning pod per week (we can see how this goes and adjust if necessary)? Make sure you only edit on your own .Rmd page to avoid conflicts in the GitHub content. Your content will show in the course book after it has been merged and I build the book again. Add the following information to your page in the course book. Describe your chosen platform in significant detail, including, as available (Wikipedia may be a good source for some of this info): ‚úîÔ∏è target audience (age, demographics, political leaning, interests, hobbies, etc) ‚úîÔ∏è can non-users browse or search content? ‚úîÔ∏è how are users connected (e.g., on some platforms, you request a connection which needs to be accepted, but on others, you can follow anyone without them reciprocating) ‚úîÔ∏è can content be shared privately? ‚úîÔ∏è how is content shared? ‚úîÔ∏è how does content go viral? ‚úîÔ∏è is the parent company public or private? ‚úîÔ∏è who are the major investors? ‚úîÔ∏è how does the company generate revenue? ‚úîÔ∏è any other pertinent information‚Ä¶ Privacy and Surveillance Download a copy of the platform‚Äôs Terms of Service (ToS) and Privacy Policy and, as a learning pod, see what you can find out about how the platform uses your data and/or tracks your movements. This will not be the most fun you‚Äôve had. Here are some resources to help you comb through the documents: ‚úîÔ∏è I read the Terms of Service, so that you don‚Äôt have to ‚úîÔ∏è Terms of Service; Didn‚Äôt Read Add the following to your platform‚Äôs page in the course book: ‚úîÔ∏è a link to your platform‚Äôs ToS and Privacy Policy ‚úîÔ∏è your key takeaways from your examination of your platform‚Äôs ToS and Privacy Policy Social Media and your PLN in Education In Week Nine, you were instructed to follow some educational accounts in your chosen social media platform. You are encouraged to find a mix of more formal accounts of teachers and administrators in K-12 and faculty and instructors in higher ed (you might also find many accounts of instructional designers and people who work in faculty development), and less formal accounts of people who are sharing their knowledge on the platform outside of formal accredited educational systems. You are also encouraged to set up accounts using the characteristics of the personas that you created a few weeks ago (if you are allowed to create such accounts), and to set up your own accounts to see how different personas ‚Äòexperience‚Äô social media differently. Feel free to interact with the educators you follow, either directly or indirectly (each platform will look different). Add the following to your platform‚Äôs page in your Learning Pod‚Äôs repo: ‚úîÔ∏è Describe how people are able to interact in your platform. Can people leave comments on content? Is there a quick and easy way to ‚ÄòLike‚Äô or ‚Äòfavourite‚Äô something? Who sees that ‚Äòlike‚Äô? Do creators generally respond to comments on their content? ‚úîÔ∏è How do educators use the platform? What kinds of content are they teaching? Who is their audience? Do they respond to comments or questions? Are they using the platform as a PLN, or are they only creating content? ‚úîÔ∏è In your Learning Pod, plan and publish more than one *SHORT educational ‚Äòpost‚Äô (whatever that looks like on your platform). Don‚Äôt put huge amounts of effort into your post. A simple ‚ÄòProTip‚Äô or ‚ÄòLifeHack‚Äô type of post, or a ‚ÄòDid you know‚Ä¶[something you know about‚Ä¶]‚Äô. Publish your posts on a few of your Learning Pod‚Äôs accounts. How do people respond to your post? Do they respond to the same post differently depending on the persona of the account? ‚úîÔ∏è Are there any concerns that educators should be aware of regarding your platform (privacy, age-inappropriate content, disinformation, misinformation, offensive or illegal content)? ‚úîÔ∏è Make note of other things you notice that a curious educator might want to know about your platform. ‚úîÔ∏è By the end of the week, you should have enough content to create a pull request to send your work over to the main course blog, where I will set up some peer reviews (not for grades).

Connectivism: A Learning Theory for the Digital Age Reference Siemens, G. (2005). Connectivism: A Learning Theory for the Digital Age. International Journal of Instructional Technology and Distance Learning, 2(1). Connectivism: A Learning Theory for the Digital Age by George Siemens is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Introduction Behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism are the three broad learning theories most often utilized in the creation of instructional environments. These theories, however, were developed in a time when learning was not impacted through technology. Over the last twenty years, technology has reorganized how we live, how we communicate, and how we learn. Learning needs and theories that describe learning principles and processes, should be reflective of underlying social environments. Vaill emphasizes that ‚Äúlearning must be a way of being ‚Äì an ongoing set of attitudes and actions by individuals and groups that they employ to try to keep abreast of the surprising, novel, messy, obtrusive, recurring events‚Ä¶‚Äù (1996, p.42). Learners as little as forty years ago would complete the required schooling and enter a career that would often last a lifetime. Information development was slow. The life of knowledge was measured in decades. Today, these foundational principles have been altered. Knowledge is growing exponentially. In many fields the life of knowledge is now measured in months and years. Gonzalez (2004) describes the challenges of rapidly diminishing knowledge life: ‚ÄúOne of the most persuasive factors is the shrinking half-life of knowledge. The ‚Äúhalf-life of knowledge‚Äù is the time span from when knowledge is gained to when it becomes obsolete. Half of what is known today was not known 10 years ago. The amount of knowledge in the world has doubled in the past 10 years and is doubling every 18 months according to the American Society of Training and Documentation (ASTD). To combat the shrinking half-life of knowledge, organizations have been forced to develop new methods of deploying instruction.‚Äù Some significant trends in learning: Many learners will move into a variety of different, possibly unrelated fields over the course of their lifetime. Informal learning is a significant aspect of our learning experience. Formal education no longer comprises the majority of our learning. Learning now occurs in a variety of ways ‚Äì through communities of practice, personal networks, and through completion of work-related tasks. Learning is a continual process, lasting for a lifetime. Learning and work related activities are no longer separate. In many situations, they are the same. Technology is altering (rewiring) our brains. The tools we use define and shape our thinking. The organization and the individual are both learning organisms. Increased attention to knowledge management highlights the need for a theory that attempts to explain the link between individual and organizational learning. Many of the processes previously handled by learning theories (especially in cognitive information processing) can now be off-loaded to, or supported by, technology. Know-how and know-what is being supplemented with know-where (the understanding of where to find knowledge needed). Background Driscoll (2000) defines learning as ‚Äúa persisting change in human performance or performance potential‚Ä¶[which] must come about as a result of the learner‚Äôs experience and interaction with the world‚Äù (p.11). This definition encompasses many of the attributes commonly associated with behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism ‚Äì namely, learning as a lasting changed state (emotional, mental, physiological (i.e.¬†skills)) brought about as a result of experiences and interactions with content or other people. Driscoll (2000, p14-17) explores some of the complexities of defining learning. Debate centers on: Valid sources of knowledge - Do we gain knowledge through experiences? Is it innate (present at birth)? Do we acquire it through thinking and reasoning? Content of knowledge ‚Äì Is knowledge actually knowable? Is it directly knowable through human experience? The final consideration focuses on three epistemological traditions in relation to learning: Objectivism, Pragmatism, and Interpretivism Objectivism (similar to behaviorism) states that reality is external and is objective, and knowledge is gained through experiences. Pragmatism (similar to cognitivism) states that reality is interpreted, and knowledge is negotiated through experience and thinking. Interpretivism (similar to constructivism) states that reality is internal, and knowledge is constructed. All of these learning theories hold the notion that knowledge is an objective (or a state) that is attainable (if not already innate) through either reasoning or experiences. Behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism (built on the epistemological traditions) attempt to address how it is that a person learns. Behaviorism states that learning is largely unknowable, that is, we can‚Äôt possibly understand what goes on inside a person (the ‚Äúblack box theory‚Äù). Gredler (2001) expresses behaviorism as being comprised of several theories that make three assumptions about learning: Observable behaviour is more important than understanding internal activities Behaviour should be focused on simple elements: specific stimuli and responses Learning is about behaviour change Cognitivism often takes a computer information processing model. Learning is viewed as a process of inputs, managed in short term memory, and coded for long-term recall. Cindy Buell details this process: ‚ÄúIn cognitive theories, knowledge is viewed as symbolic mental constructs in the learner‚Äôs mind, and the learning process is the means by which these symbolic representations are committed to memory.‚Äù Constructivism suggests that learners create knowledge as they attempt to understand their experiences (Driscoll, 2000, p.¬†376). Behaviorism and cognitivism view knowledge as external to the learner and the learning process as the act of internalizing knowledge. Constructivism assumes that learners are not empty vessels to be filled with knowledge. Instead, learners are actively attempting to create meaning. Learners often select and pursue their own learning. Constructivist principles acknowledge that real-life learning is messy and complex. Classrooms which emulate the ‚Äúfuzziness‚Äù of this learning will be more effective in preparing learners for life-long learning. Limitations of Behaviorism, Cognitivism, and Constructivism A central tenet of most learning theories is that learning occurs inside a person. Even social constructivist views, which hold that learning is a socially enacted process, promotes the principality of the individual (and her/his physical presence ‚Äì i.e.¬†brain-based) in learning. These theories do not address learning that occurs outside of people (i.e.¬†learning that is stored and manipulated by technology). They also fail to describe how learning happens within organizations Learning theories are concerned with the actual process of learning, not with the value of what is being learned. In a networked world, the very manner of information that we acquire is worth exploring. The need to evaluate the worthiness of learning something is a meta-skill that is applied before learning itself begins. When knowledge is subject to paucity, the process of assessing worthiness is assumed to be intrinsic to learning. When knowledge is abundant, the rapid evaluation of knowledge is important. Additional concerns arise from the rapid increase in information. In today‚Äôs environment, action is often needed without personal learning ‚Äì that is, we need to act by drawing information outside of our primary knowledge. The ability to synthesize and recognize connections and patterns is a valuable skill. Many important questions are raised when established learning theories are seen through technology. The natural attempt of theorists is to continue to revise and evolve theories as conditions change. At some point, however, the underlying conditions have altered so significantly, that further modification is no longer sensible. An entirely new approach is needed. Some questions to explore in relation to learning theories and the impact of technology and new sciences (chaos and networks) on learning: How are learning theories impacted when knowledge is no longer acquired in the linear manner? What adjustments need to made with learning theories when technology performs many of the cognitive operations previously performed by learners (information storage and retrieval). How can we continue to stay current in a rapidly evolving information ecology? How do learning theories address moments where performance is needed in the absence of complete understanding? What is the impact of networks and complexity theories on learning? What is the impact of chaos as a complex pattern recognition process on learning? With increased recognition of interconnections in differing fields of knowledge, how are systems and ecology theories perceived in light of learning tasks? An Alternative Theory Including technology and connection making as learning activities begins to move learning theories into a digital age. We can no longer personally experience and acquire learning that we need to act. We derive our competence from forming connections. Karen Stephenson states: ‚ÄúExperience has long been considered the best teacher of knowledge. Since we cannot experience everything, other people‚Äôs experiences, and hence other people, become the surrogate for knowledge. ‚ÄòI store my knowledge in my friends‚Äô is an axiom for collecting knowledge through collecting people (undated).‚Äù Chaos is a new reality for knowledge workers. ScienceWeek (2004) quotes Nigel Calder‚Äôs definition that chaos is ‚Äúa cryptic form of order‚Äù. Chaos is the breakdown of predictability, evidenced in complicated arrangements that initially defy order. Unlike constructivism, which states that learners attempt to foster understanding by meaning making tasks, chaos states that the meaning exists ‚Äì the learner‚Äôs challenge is to recognize the patterns which appear to be hidden. Meaning-making and forming connections between specialized communities are important activities. Chaos, as a science, recognizes the connection of everything to everything. Gleick (1987) states: ‚ÄúIn weather, for example, this translates into what is only half-jokingly known as the Butterfly Effect ‚Äì the notion that a butterfly stirring the air today in Peking can transform storm systems next month in New York‚Äù (p.¬†8). This analogy highlights a real challenge: ‚Äúsensitive dependence on initial conditions‚Äù profoundly impacts what we learn and how we act based on our learning. Decision making is indicative of this. If the underlying conditions used to make decisions change, the decision itself is no longer as correct as it was at the time it was made. The ability to recognize and adjust to pattern shifts is a key learning task. Luis Mateus Rocha (1998) defines self-organization as the ‚Äúspontaneous formation of well organized structures, patterns, or behaviors, from random initial conditions.‚Äù (p.3). Learning, as a self-organizing process requires that the system (personal or organizational learning systems) ‚Äúbe informationally open, that is, for it to be able to classify its own interaction with an environment, it must be able to change its structure‚Ä¶‚Äù (p.4). Wiley and Edwards acknowledge the importance of self-organization as a learning process: ‚ÄúJacobs argues that communities self-organize is a manner similar to social insects: instead of thousands of ants crossing each other‚Äôs pheromone trails and changing their behavior accordingly, thousands of humans pass each other on the sidewalk and change their behavior accordingly.‚Äù. Self-organization on a personal level is a micro-process of the larger self-organizing knowledge constructs created within corporate or institutional environments. The capacity to form connections between sources of information, and thereby create useful information patterns, is required to learn in our knowledge economy. Networks, Small Worlds, Weak Ties A network can simply be defined as connections between entities. Computer networks, power grids, and social networks all function on the simple principle that people, groups, systems, nodes, entities can be connected to create an integrated whole. Alterations within the network have ripple effects on the whole. Albert-L√°szl√≥ Barab√°si states that ‚Äúnodes always compete for connections because links represent survival in an interconnected world‚Äù (2002, p.106). This competition is largely dulled within a personal learning network, but the placing of value on certain nodes over others is a reality. Nodes that successfully acquire greater profile will be more successful at acquiring additional connections. In a learning sense, the likelihood that a concept of learning will be linked depends on how well it is currently linked. Nodes (can be fields, ideas, communities) that specialize and gain recognition for their expertise have greater chances of recognition, thus resulting in cross-pollination of learning communities. Weak ties are links or bridges that allow short connections between information. Our small world networks are generally populated with people whose interests and knowledge are similar to ours. Finding a new job, as an example, often occurs through weak ties. This principle has great merit in the notion of serendipity, innovation, and creativity. Connections between disparate ideas and fields can create new innovations. Connectivism Connectivism is the integration of principles explored by chaos, network, and complexity and self-organization theories. Learning is a process that occurs within nebulous environments of shifting core elements ‚Äì not entirely under the control of the individual. Learning (defined as actionable knowledge) can reside outside of ourselves (within an organization or a database), is focused on connecting specialized information sets, and the connections that enable us to learn more are more important than our current state of knowing. Connectivism is driven by the understanding that decisions are based on rapidly altering foundations. New information is continually being acquired. The ability to draw distinctions between important and unimportant information is vital. The ability to recognize when new information alters the landscape based on decisions made yesterday is also critical. Principles of connectivism: Learning and knowledge rests in diversity of opinions. Learning is a process of connecting specialized nodes or information sources. Learning may reside in non-human appliances. Capacity to know more is more critical than what is currently known Nurturing and maintaining connections is needed to facilitate continual learning. Ability to see connections between fields, ideas, and concepts is a core skill. Currency (accurate, up-to-date knowledge) is the intent of all connectivist learning activities. Decision-making is itself a learning process. Choosing what to learn and the meaning of incoming information is seen through the lens of a shifting reality. While there is a right answer now, it may be wrong tomorrow due to alterations in the information climate affecting the decision. Connectivism also addresses the challenges that many corporations face in knowledge management activities. Knowledge that resides in a database needs to be connected with the right people in the right context in order to be classified as learning. Behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism do not attempt to address the challenges of organizational knowledge and transference. Information flow within an organization is an important element in organizational effectiveness. In a knowledge economy, the flow of information is the equivalent of the oil pipe in an industrial economy. Creating, preserving, and utilizing information flow should be a key organizational activity. Knowledge flow can be likened to a river that meanders through the ecology of an organization. In certain areas, the river pools and in other areas it ebbs. The health of the learning ecology of the organization depends on effective nurturing of information flow. Social network analysis is an additional element in understanding learning models in a digital era. Art Kleiner (2002) explores Karen Stephenson‚Äôs ‚Äúquantum theory of trust‚Äù which ‚Äúexplains not just how to recognize the collective cognitive capability of an organization, but how to cultivate and increase it‚Äù. Within social networks, hubs are well-connected people who are able to foster and maintain knowledge flow. Their interdependence results in effective knowledge flow, enabling the personal understanding of the state of activities organizationally. The starting point of connectivism is the individual. Personal knowledge is comprised of a network, which feeds into organizations and institutions, which in turn feed back into the network, and then continue to provide learning to individual. This cycle of knowledge development (personal to network to organization) allows learners to remain current in their field through the connections they have formed. Landauer and Dumais (1997) explore the phenomenon that ‚Äúpeople have much more knowledge than appears to be present in the information to which they have been exposed‚Äù. They provide a connectivist focus in stating ‚Äúthe simple notion that some domains of knowledge contain vast numbers of weak interrelations that, if properly exploited, can greatly amplify learning by a process of inference‚Äù. The value of pattern recognition and connecting our own ‚Äúsmall worlds of knowledge‚Äù are apparent in the exponential impact provided to our personal learning. John Seely Brown presents an interesting notion that the internet leverages the small efforts of many with the large efforts of few. The central premise is that connections created with unusual nodes supports and intensifies existing large effort activities. Brown provides the example of a Maricopa County Community College system project that links senior citizens with elementary school students in a mentor program. The children ‚Äúlisten to these ‚Äúgrandparents‚Äù better than they do their own parents, the mentoring really helps the teachers‚Ä¶the small efforts of the many- the seniors ‚Äì complement the large efforts of the few ‚Äì the teachers.‚Äù (2002). This amplification of learning, knowledge and understanding through the extension of a personal network is the epitome of connectivism. Implications The notion of connectivism has implications in all aspects of life. This paper largely focuses on its impact on learning, but the following aspects are also impacted: Management and leadership. The management and marshalling of resources to achieve desired outcomes is a significant challenge. Realizing that complete knowledge cannot exist in the mind of one person requires a different approach to creating an overview of the situation. Diverse teams of varying viewpoints are a critical structure for completely exploring ideas. Innovation is also an additional challenge. Most of the revolutionary ideas of today at one time existed as a fringe element. An organizations ability to foster, nurture, and synthesize the impacts of varying views of information is critical to knowledge economy survival. Speed of ‚Äúidea to implementation‚Äù is also improved in a systems view of learning. Media, news, information. This trend is well under way. Mainstream media organizations are being challenged by the open, real-time, two-way information flow of blogging. Personal knowledge management in relation to organizational knowledge management Design of learning environments Conclusion The pipe is more important than the content within the pipe. Our ability to learn what we need for tomorrow is more important than what we know today. A real challenge for any learning theory is to actuate known knowledge at the point of application. When knowledge, however, is needed, but not known, the ability to plug into sources to meet the requirements becomes a vital skill. As knowledge continues to grow and evolve, access to what is needed is more important than what the learner currently possesses. Connectivism presents a model of learning that acknowledges the tectonic shifts in society where learning is no longer an internal, individualistic activity. How people work and function is altered when new tools are utilized. The field of education has been slow to recognize both the impact of new learning tools and the environmental changes in what it means to learn. Connectivism provides insight into learning skills and tasks needed for learners to flourish in a digital era. References Barab√°si, A.

Visitors and Residents: A new typology for online engagement. First Monday. Visitors and Residents: A new typology for online engagement by Dave S. White and Alison Le Cornu is marked with CC0 1.0 Abstract This article proposes a continuum of ‚ÄòVisitors‚Äô and ‚ÄòResidents‚Äô as a replacement for Prensky‚Äôs much‚Äêcriticised Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants. Challenging the basic premises upon which Prensky constructed his typology, Visitors and Residents fulfil a similar purpose in mapping individuals‚Äô engagement with the Web. We argue that the metaphors of ‚Äòplace‚Äô and ‚Äòtool‚Äô most appropriately represent the use of technology in contemporary society, especially given the advent of social media. The Visitors and Residents continuum accounts for people behaving in different ways when using technology, depending on their motivation and context, without categorising them according to age or background. A wider and more accurate representation of online behaviour is therefore established. Introduction ‚ÄòThe digital natives/digital immigrants distinction is dead or at least dying‚Äô. So proclaims Doug Holton in his blogpost. He continues: ‚ÄòUnfortunately, the idea is still uncritically accepted even in some journal articles, and perhaps used as an excuse or crutch too often for poor or ineffective teaching practices‚Äô. Holton is not alone in his criticism. McKenzie (2007) writes strongly against Prensky‚Äôs (2001a, b) typology identifying a number of ‚Äòthinly supported claims‚Äô, while Kennedy, et al.¬†(2010) demonstrate through an empirical research project that Prensky‚Äôs age‚Äìrelated hypothesis is very much less clear‚Äìcut than the Natives and Immigrants dichotomy implies. Our intention in this article is to propose an alternative, which we have termed ‚ÄòVisitors and Residents‚Äô. Prensky‚Äôs distinction between people who are entirely at ease within a digital environment and those who manage to learn to exist but who (in his view) will never be fully competent, has gained enormous currency and, until recently, widespread acceptance. Similarly, his linked assertion that the differentiation also signals the need for an educational revolution, requiring a new approach which accommodates the up‚Äìand‚Äìcoming Natives, has not only been largely believed but has provoked a sense of panic among ‚ÄòImmigrant educators‚Äô who now perceive themselves wrong‚Äìfooted and unable to step up to the plate. Prensky himself has expressed doubts over the validity of his thinking (Prensky, 2009). Nor is he the first to try and analyse perceived behaviours of learners by categorising them into types. The benefits of so doing, as well as the disadvantages, are well recognised: benefits are that these categories allow others to use this new knowledge to augment the learning experience; disadvantages focus principally on the inflexibility of types, as well as the tendency to box individuals into one type or another, overlooking contradictory evidence. Theories of learning styles favour typologies of this sort, as do certain theories of human development, and many struggle to allow individuals the space simultaneously to exhibit traits characteristic of different types. Why, then, would we want to propose an alternative to Prensky‚Äôs Natives and Immigrants? Firstly, we recognise the usefulness of these typologies, despite their drawbacks. Secondly, we feel that although many criticisms of Prensky are valid, he initiated an important dialogue and offered a framework which those concerned with the quality and effectiveness of education delivered electronically could use. He was one of the first to do this in a fast‚Äìmoving domain and this contribution should be acknowledged. His Natives and Immigrants were hypothetical children of their time, however, and we believe that as our understanding has developed, it is appropriate to re‚Äìevaluate what was previously accepted and to change it to suit the purposes of today. Not only so, but there are many instances ‚Äî to the point, perhaps, of being a general and widespread habit ‚Äî where Prensky‚Äôs ideas on Natives and Immigrants have been inappropriately transported into a social media context, paradoxically finding themselves as ‚Äòimmigrants‚Äô in a new land. We introduce our discussion in section II by critiquing Prensky‚Äôs Natives and Immigrants with a specific focus on the nature of the metaphor. The section also suggests that in the ten years since Prensky published his Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants (2001), technology, computer applications, and hence the way in which education takes place, have moved on to the point that the Native/Immigrant dichotomy is now redundant. In section III we explore new metaphors of tool, place and space, and, in section IV, therefore, we present our alternative which builds on yet replaces one of the underdeveloped strengths in Prensky‚Äôs typology using in particular, the metaphor of place. We make the assumption of familiarity with Prenky‚Äôs work and for that reason do not summarise it here [1]. Prensky‚Äôs Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants: A critique Metaphors: Language and age Key to Prensky‚Äôs typology is the connection he made between computing competence and age. In his original paper, he writes: What should we call these ‚Äúnew‚Äù students of today? Some refer to them as the N‚Äì[for Net]‚Äìgen or D‚Äì[for digital]‚Äìgen. But the most useful designation I have found for them is Digital Natives. Our students today are all ‚Äúnative speakers‚Äù of the digital language of computers, video games and the Internet. So what does that make the rest of us? Those of us who were not born into the digital world but have, at some later point in our lives, become fascinated by and adopted many or most aspects of the new technology are, and always will be compared to them, Digital Immigrants The importance of the distinction is this: As Digital Immigrants learn ‚Äî like all immigrants, some better than others ‚Äî to adapt to their environment, they always retain, to some degree, their ‚Äúaccent,‚Äù that is, their foot in the past. The ‚Äúdigital immigrant accent‚Äù can be seen in such things as turning to the Internet for information second rather than first, or in reading the manual for a program rather than assuming that the program itself will teach us to use it. Today‚Äôs older folk were ‚Äúsocialized‚Äù differently from their kids, and are now in the process of learning a new language. And a language learned later in life, scientists tell us, goes into a different part of the brain. [2] Prensky‚Äôs language‚Äìbased analogy is compelling and it is easy to see why it quickly commanded attention. Recently, however, challenges have been mounted that separate the two dimensions and call into question, in particular, whether it is genuinely the case firstly that older learners are really as handicapped as Prensky suggests, and secondly that younger learners are as privileged as he understands them to be. Ten years on, evidence and logic challenge both positions, with, for example, comments such as the following from Bennett, et al.¬†(2008): Though limited in scope and focus, the research evidence to date indicates that a proportion of young people are highly adept with technology and rely on it for a range of information gathering and communication activities. However, there also appears to be a significant proportion of young people who do not have the levels of access or technology skills predicted by proponents of the digital native idea. Such generalisations about a whole generation of young people thereby focus attention on technically adept students. With this comes the danger that those less interested and less able will be neglected, and that the potential impact of socio‚Äìeconomic and cultural factors will be overlooked. It may be that there is as much variation within the digital native generation as between the generations. [3] Similarly, Margaryan and Littlejohn write: Many young students are far from being the epitomic global, connected, socially networked technologically‚Äìfluent digital native who has little patience for passive and linear forms of learning. While the use of technologies is limited in terms of the range and the nature, there is some evidence that younger students use some tools more actively than the older students, but neither of these two groups uses these technologies to support their learning effectively. Educators therefore cannot presume that all young students are ‚Äúdigital natives‚Äù who understand how to use technology to support and enhance their learning. [4] It is increasingly clear that, just as is the case for almost every subject discipline and expertise, some learners will acquire the requisite skills quickly, while others will struggle, regardless of age. It is also significant that formal bodies which regularly survey Internet use, such as Oxford Internet Surveys (OxIS), do not use specifically age‚Äìrelated categories for their data collection, but rather life‚Äìstage categories. The majority of OxIS 2009 surveys on The Internet in Britain focus on students, employed and retired people, making no inferences about any commensurate age‚Äìrelated dimensions. The implication is that each category is equally technologically competent, but their respective life‚Äìstage leads them to different types of use. For the purposes of this paper our goal is not to disprove Prensky‚Äôs thesis per se, but instead to challenge the underlying metaphor of language‚Äì and second‚Äìlanguage‚Äìlearning which he builds his case on, and then to offer an alternative. We want to ask questions such as: Can learning technological skills be likened to that of language learning? Is the analogy appropriate? If not, can another more appropriate metaphor be identified? It is undoubtedly significant that there has been a move towards speaking of digital literacies (rather than, for example, digital languages) in recent years. Lankshear and Knobel (2008) draw attention to the move from the singular ‚Äòliteracy‚Äô to the plural ‚Äòliteracies‚Äô, a move of which they approve on account of, amongst other things, &amp;rlsquo;the sheer diversity of specific accounts of ‚Äúdigital literacy‚Äù that exist, and consequent implications of that for digital literacy policies‚Äô [5]. They also provide a useful summary of the ways in which ‚Äòdigital literacy‚Äô has been interpreted and used. These include: Mastering ideas, not keystrokes (Bawden, 2008, citing Gilster, 1997) Conceptual definitions as distinct from standardized operational definitions (Lankshear and Knobel, 2006) Individuals‚Äô ability to participate in a multimodal culture (Jenkins, et al., 2006) Lankshear and Knobel conclude [6]: This sheer variety means that digital literacy can be seen as ‚Äúa framework for integrating various other literacies and skill‚Äìsets‚Äù without ‚Äúthe need to encompass them all‚Äù or to serve as ‚Äúone literacy to rule them all‚Äù (Martin cited in Bawden, Chapter 1 here; Martin, 2006). Equally, however, it reminds us that any attempt to constitute an umbrella definition or overarching frame of digital literacy will necessarily involve reconciling the claims of myriad concepts of digital literacy, a veritable legion of digital literacies. There are undoubtedly similarities between mastering this range of literacies and learning a second language, although research about precisely how people learn a new language in adulthood constitutes a complete field in its own right and cannot be explored here. Yet this still seems not to be Prensky‚Äôs principal focus. Instead, he targets the foreign accent which remains and which will always be the giveaway of someone‚Äôs background and origins. For him, the accent is a matter of habit or of first course of action. So, as the above quote demonstrates, the instinct not to go to the Internet (presumably in favour of using a paper‚Äìbased encyclopedia) when searching for information, or the tendency to read an instruction manual (also paper‚Äìbased) rather than work out how something functions by trial and error, are both recognisable ‚Äòaccents‚Äô. Once again, it is easy to challenge these assertions. Now that the Internet has been in widespread use in educational establishments for around 15 years, it has clearly become the source of information chosen first by seekers, regardless of age [7]. In many cases the Internet is now the sole up-to-date source of information, and certainly the sole source which offers much free‚Äìof‚Äìcharge. Secondly, reading an instruction manual for other tasks (assembling flat‚Äìpacked furniture, using a new piece of machinery for the first time, getting to know a new smart phone, etc.) is often a last resort once again for people of all ages. In this paper we demonstrate that that Prensky was: a) over hasty in appropriating an analogy which cannot bear the weight required of it; and, b) imprecise in his combination of diverse elements (second‚Äìlanguage learning, accent, habit and age, linking all these to brain development) which cannot be legitimately combined to make his case. We seek to propose an alternative, highlighting how the advent of social media has dramatically changed the terrain of computer‚Äìmediated education, which in turn has enabled us to place a different metaphor, that of ‚Äòplace‚Äô, at centre stage and offer the analogy of Visitors and Residents as alternatives to Digital Natives and Immigrants. Towards a new metaphor of engagement with online technology Prensky‚Äôs Natives and Immigrants pre‚Äìdate the launching of what are now commonly known as social media applications. The social bookmarking site Delicious, for example, was launched in 2003 as was MySpace. Both Facebook and World of Warcraft [8] launched in 2004; Bebo and YouTube in 2005; and, Twitter in 2006. Prior to 2003, the Internet was used primarily as a means of finding information with Google leading the way since 1997 in offering an effective means of searching for and gathering information. A key distinction between information‚Äìgathering versus social‚Äìnetworking sites is that the latter invite individuals to project their personas online as a ‚Äòdigital identity‚Äô via text, image and video. Furthermore, social media platforms facilitate the construction, by the individual, of complex social networks not constrained by physical geography. These are critical shifts in the use of the internet which we suggest are transforming the nature of relationships, citizenship and learning. In response to these changes the metaphors which we suggest best represent the engagement with online technology now widely experienced are those of ‚Äòtool‚Äô and ‚Äòplace/space‚Äô. This section looks at both. Certain platforms on the Web fit quite neatly under the metaphor of ‚Äòtool‚Äô, while others are more closely aligned to the metaphor of ‚Äòplace‚Äô. ‚ÄòTool‚Äô is functional and may provide a bridge between Prensky‚Äôs understanding of how people used computer technology and that which we propose. ‚ÄòPlace‚Äô, on the other hand, is social. Increasingly, the two overlap. The metaphors of tool, place and space Until recently, with the exception of gaming, computing was almost solely linked to ideas of efficiency and goal‚Äìorientated functionality. Only now are we witnessing the social appropriation of new computing technologies. Microsoft‚Äôs Office suite is an excellent example of this, as well as of the skills that people needed to use the applications effectively. Each application had ‚Äî and has ‚Äî a specific purpose that enabled users to do something. It functioned as a tool, a means to an end; users learned and practised skills, developing varying degrees of competence and confidence in achieving their desired ends. Despite numerous iterations of these platforms and of computing operating systems, a set of generally‚Äìaccepted principles of good practice emerged relating to what users needed and how they could access this most effectively, with the result that users could develop a set of transferable skills applicable across a range of platforms and become computer literate. In the abrupt cultural shift towards the construction of social networks, we argue that the analogies of language and age cease to function and believe that a metaphor of place is more fit for the purpose of understanding different behaviours and potentially aptitudes. The use of ‚Äòplace‚Äô as a metaphor to conceptualise the ‚Äòvirtual‚Äô nature of the Web is not new (see Johnston, 2009; Wenger, et al., 2009). However, our definition of place does not make a hard distinction between the virtual and the physical; on the contrary, we are proposing that place is primarily a sense of being present with others. A sense of social presence (White and Le Cornu, 2010) is something those who spend time on social media platforms experience to a high level, with the effect of foregrounding a broad sense of digital identity. This in turn results in a type of personification within social media spaces as people project aspects of their identity to an imagined audience (see Marwick and boyd, 2010). The social dimension of computing has brought about a paradigm shift in many individuals‚Äô experience of computer use as well as influenced their attitude and motivation towards the use and purpose of connected digital technologies. The metaphor of ‚Äòplace‚Äô is therefore one which lends itself very easily to the experience people have when they are engaged and interacting socially with others via a computer. It is not uncommon to hear people asking each other if they have ‚Äòbeen‚Äô ‚Äòin‚Äô to Facebook today, for example. One of the key features is the fact that people can still meet in an area common to all of them, and for that reason an impression of location and of social space is created. Just as physical, geographical places have architectural characteristics and town planners can make a real‚Äìlife city more, or less, user‚Äìfriendly to navigate, so software designers are responsible for the navigability of platforms, and Facebook users are familiar with the frustration of suddenly ‚Äòlosing their way‚Äô when the platform is upgraded and changed. In all of these experiences, the metaphors of space and place are used to describe what is going on. The distinction between and shift from people‚Äôs appropriation of computer programmes as tools to thinking of platforms as social spaces is clearly identifiable in an application such as Google Docs. In its original basic form, Google Docs offers a functional tool whereby users can create documents and make them available to others. While this is happening at an individual level, the application remains a tool. As soon as another person, or people, join in and participate in editing and sharing in the creation of the document, a social place is created. Users can reconsider their actions in a kind of social context, discussing with each other aspects of the document and experiencing a social dimension as well as functional. We therefore argue that tools, places and spaces are the three key metaphors that most aptly describe the experience of computer users in a world where social media are becoming more and more prevalent. We suggest that Prenksy‚Äôs understanding of ‚Äòplace‚Äô was limited and tagged to his principal metaphor of language; we are now suggesting that this metaphor should be appropriately contextualised and to occupy centre stage in any discussion about how people interact with each other and with content when both are electronically mediated, and be linked to the metaphor of tool. This then allows the formulation of a new typology, that of Visitors and Residents. These are explored in the next section. Visitors and Residents Visitors We propose that Visitors understand the Web as akin to an untidy garden tool shed. They have defined a goal or task and go into the shed to select an appropriate tool which they use to attain their goal. Task over, the tool is returned to the shed. It may not have been perfect for the task, but they are happy to make do so long as some progress is made. This is important, since Visitors need to see some concrete benefit resulting from their use of the platform. Significantly, Visitors are unlikely to have any form of persistent profile online which projects their identity into the digital space. They are anonymous, their activity invisible to all but the databases running the Web sites they use. Individuals who most closely fit the Visitor approach give a number of reasons for not wanting a ‚Äòdigital identity‚Äô which would persist in some form even when they were not online. Issues of privacy and fear of identity theft are paramount [9] but there is also a sense that social networking activities are banal and egotistical. Implicit in this is the idea that if you have a ‚Äòreal‚Äô social life and network of friends then you wouldn‚Äôt choose to socialise online in a visible manner. It is this visibility, or the ‚Äòbroadcast‚Äô nature of the visibility, which is key; Visitors are not averse to using e‚Äìmail or Skype to maintain relationships but they are wary of creating a Facebook profile. Visitors then see the Web as primarily a set of tools which deliver or manipulate content (this can include the content of a conversation because, as mentioned, they are happy to accept the Web as a useful conduit for interpersonal communication). This content is often distanced as far as possible from personal opinion (unless a competent authority is in evidence or a pre‚Äìexisting off‚Äìline relationship). In effect, the ‚Äònon‚Äìreferenced‚Äô or non‚Äìexpert opinion and notions such as the wisdom of the crowd are avoided. Ultimately to Visitors the Web is simply one of many tools they can use to achieve certain goals; it is categorised alongside the telephone, books, pen and paper and off‚Äìline software. It is not a ‚Äòplace‚Äô to think or to develop ideas and to put it crudely, and at its most extreme, Visitors do their thinking off‚Äìline. So Visitors are users, not members, of the Web and place little value in belonging online. Residents Residents, on the other hand, see the Web as a place, perhaps like a park or a building in which there are clusters of friends and colleagues whom they can approach and with whom they can share information about their life and work. A proportion of their lives is actually lived out online where the distinction between online and off‚Äìline is increasingly blurred. Residents are happy to go online simply to spend time with others and they are likely to consider that they ‚Äòbelong‚Äô to a community which is located in the virtual. They have a profile in social networking platforms such as Facebook or Twitter and are comfortable expressing their persona in these online spaces. To Residents, the Web is a place to express opinions, a place in which relationships can be formed and extended. While they use ‚Äòtools‚Äô such as online banking and shopping systems they also use the Web to maintain and develop a digital identity. Since they also undertake many of the activities that Visitors do, their residency is an additional layer of interaction and activity. When Residents log off, an aspect of their persona remains. This could be in many forms ranging from status updates to social networking platforms, to artefacts in media sharing sites or opinions expressed in blog posts or blog comments. Residents see the Web primarily as a network of individuals or clusters of individuals who in turn generate content. Value online is assessed in terms of relationships as well as knowledge. Residents do not make a clear distinction between concepts of content and of persona. A blog post is as much an expression of identity as it is a discussion of particular ideas. The fact that Wikipedia has been authored collectively is not a concern, what is important is how relevant the information they find is to their particular needs. Discussion Our Visitors and Residents typology should be understood as a continuum and not a binary opposition. Individuals may be able to place themselves at a particular point along this continuum rather than in one of two boxes. Nor is a predominantly Visitor approach necessarily any less effective or of less value than a predominantly Resident approach since the value of either has to be set against a given context and set of goals. Similarly, we do not consider the Visitor to be necessarily any less technically adept than the Resident. The concept of ‚Äòtechnical‚Äô aptitude should be viewed as more than simply an ability to manipulate hardware and software. It is more useful to think of the ‚Äòtechnical‚Äô as extending into skill sets required by a given discipline, such as the ability to research a given topic. This definition of the technical then intersects with the notion of digital literacy which is a more useful framework to assess the value of given approaches, the relative merits of which are discussed in reports such as Beetham, et al.‚Äôs (2009) LLiDA project and Gillen and Barton‚Äôs (2010) Digital literacies (PDF). A simple reading of this typology might lead one to believe that the category of Visitor is somehow a subset of that of Resident or that the goal of Visitors should be to extend their skills towards the Resident end of the continuum. Stoerger (2009) introduces this idea in her ‚Äòdigital melting pot‚Äô analogy by suggesting that Web users with a range of competencies can simply learn from each other by mingling in shared spaces on the Web. This does not take into account the motivation behind a type of engagement with the Web, however, and assumes, again, that technical aptitude is directly linked to being ‚Äòsuccessful‚Äô in the online environment. Nevertheless, it is often much more efficient to research a particular topic in such a way that meets the needs of traditional educational requirements (essays, exams) if a Visitor approach is taken. Visitors‚Äô technical and intellectual skills in the pursuit of specific content may well be significantly more sophisticated than Residents‚Äô, regardless of their age (and here we specifically challenge Prensky‚Äôs belief that older people will never achieve as high a degree of technical aptitude as younger people). Similarly it has been suggested that aptitude in social media platforms often does not translate into other online spaces or tools (Stoerger, 2009), although this is difficult to quantify. Residents‚Äô ability to engage with ‚Äònew‚Äô platforms in ways in which appear culturally novel or radical does not equip them to negotiate Wikipedia or an online library catalogue successfully either in terms of functionality or the literacy skills required. The literacy required is not simply one of off‚Äìline/online or gamer/non‚Äìgamer; online literacies differ between platforms, although to an outsider the skills required may seem equivalent and there is a certain commonality in the acquisition of transferable skills. However, the notion of social networking platforms masks the fact that for many ‚Äòexpert‚Äô Facebook users Twitter is relatively undecipherable. At one level this can be accounted for by the difference in functionality, but it also relates to the literacies required for the respective platforms, together with the motivation. The two platforms serve quite different purposes. It would be easy simply to categorise individuals at a particular point along the Visitor/Resident continuum with some indication of their potential direction of travel. This labelling of individuals as a single type or as representing a single form of behaviour is where, as mentioned earlier, the nature of a typology can fall down. As Wenger (1998) has highlighted, we are all members of multiple communities and have to negotiate our roles and identities as we navigate the ‚Äònexus‚Äô of communities we belong to. In a similar manner an individual‚Äôs approach to the Web is likely to change dependent on context. For example, an individual might take a Resident approach in their private life but a Visitor approach in their role as a professional. Similarly it is not unusual for someone in a leadership role in a special interest group to manage that responsibility in a Resident style online while in a personal or professional context they choose to act as a Visitor. Individuals are generally very good at managing their differing approaches across contexts and have much experience of similar shifts in attitude and motivation as they move between roles played out in physical spaces. However, the ubiquity of the Web across these traditional physical boundaries is beginning to pose challenges, blurring the boundaries of traditional contexts, which Marwick and boyd (2010) describe as ‚Äòcontext collapse‚Äô. A good example of this is the Visitor tutor/academic whose rather more Resident personal life is discovered by their students. There is growing evidence (e.g., boyd, 2008; Helsper and Eynon, 2009; Tenopir and Rowlands, 2007; CiBER, 2007) that while age may be less of a factor in technology use than Prensky envisaged, factors such as conceptions of privacy and the notions of friendship may be shifting generationally. In fact the cultural effects of the social hyperconnectivity brought about by social media and mobile devices are often masked by shallow assessments of technological functionality and the apparent capability of specific groups in consuming ‚Äònew‚Äô technology. Conclusion We propose that our Visitors and Residents paradigm not only describes the lived experience and practice of technological engagement in a more accurate way than Prensky‚Äôs Natives and Immigrants, but it is based on a more secure foundation. Our typology of Visitors and Residents turn to the metaphor of place to provide an analytic framework, but the strength of moving away from language and accent and placing the emphasis on motivation allows for a wide variety of practices which span all age groups and does not require individuals to be boxed, inexorably, in one category or the other. Both ‚Äòplace‚Äô and ‚Äòtool‚Äô have the capacity to incorporate motivation. Questions such as: ‚ÄòWhat am I going there for?‚Äô, ‚ÄòWhat am I hoping to achieve?‚Äô, ‚ÄòWhich place best serves my purpose?‚Äô, ‚ÄòHow long do I intend to stay?‚Äô, ‚ÄòHave I got the skills that I need?‚Äô and ‚ÄòAm I happy to be on my own, or would I prefer to be in company?‚Äô all fit within the Visitors and Residents paradigm and transcend issues such as age, technological ‚Äògeekishness‚Äô, and the development of the brain, while still recognising that individuals may have a greater or less well developed natural aptitude for using technology and that some may never move (we avoid the term ‚Äòprogress‚Äô) beyond a low‚Äìlevel engagement of selecting a small range of tools for a limited number of purposes. Another strength of the paradigm is our understanding of it as a continuum along the lines of that depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1. Visitors and Residents Clearly, some people may operate entirely as Visitors, visiting specific Web places for specific purposes, entirely on their own and never leaving a footprint behind. At the other extreme, ‚Äòtotal‚Äô Residents (equally small in number, we suggest) spend all their online time in social interaction, never using the Internet for information‚Äìgathering yet leaving behind significant evidence of their presence. More representative of the majority of Internet use is that which takes place within the central box. Individuals move around the box, sometimes functioning more as Visitors, sometimes more as Residents, according to their motivation. Prensky made a deliberate connection between his Natives and Immigrants and people‚Äôs learning styles, preferences, and ultimately, abilities. Our Visitors and Residents paradigm also has educational implications that we have been unable to explore in this paper, but which we do in a following paper. In this, we shall look at understanding and setting expectations, practical aspects to bear in mind when engaging students online (especially when dealing with a large cohort, which is often the case), and explore some of the ways in which Visitors and Residents interacts with current understandings of and calls for digital literacy.
