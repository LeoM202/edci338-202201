## Digital Identity 

## Privacy and Sureillance 

## Access and Inclusion  
Inclusive design aims to provide the user with a good experience. It is known as shifting away from the idea of “one-size-fits-all”. And moving towards creating a design for a diverse range of users. Accessibility on social media platforms is in relation to recognizing exclusion and displaying information in a clear manner. 
Instagram provides the following to increase inclusion and accessibility:
- Automatic captioning
- Alt-image descriptions
- Include descriptive captions
- Screen reading
- Adjust text size
- Manage video captions 
Following are the ways in which people can produce content to meet accessibility needs:
- Writing in plain language
- Adding hashtags and mentions
- Limit emoji use
- Avoid special characters
- Descriptive image captions
- Use good color contrast: Avoid color contrasts that are difficult to read
- Promote positive inclusion 

## Trust and Misinformation 
Instagram works with third party fact checkers to identify, review and label false information. Additionally, instagram also has multiple community guidelines for user motivation to continue being an authentic and safe platform. 
Those guidelines include: 
- Users should only share content that they have right to share 
- Users may only post comments that are appropriate for a diverse audience 
- Users must follow Law and not spread misinformation in relation to sensitive topics such as:
    - Bullying 
    - Alcohol 
    - Tobacco products 
    - Hate 
    - Sexual services 
    - Drugs
- Users must respect all members of the instagram community

## Public Discourse 
High profile individuals usually use instagram for different reasons, it could be to interact with more people, or for promoting a brand through their pictures and videos, or could also be to share important information/content. 
Some benefits of being in the public eye and having a PLN are:
- Individuals can interact with more people in an easier way
- Make relationships with high profile individuals 
- Gain more knowledge for products/companies/brands interested in 
Some benefits of building a community with online tools by an employer is that the tools created could be safer than social media tools. This is because on social media tools everything is open source and all the information is public. Whereas a tool made by an employer can be more private and could follow security guidelines for employee safety. 

We can ensure that a PLN is safe and reliable if users follow the guidelines set by the community. 

Veteran story tellers could connect with third party fact checkers to identify misinformation. Or they could also use different sources to find information and cross check if the information matches. 

## Education 
Instagram is a unique social media network, it is built almost entirely around sharing images and videos. You can get Instagram on smartphones, and Instagram has a desktop version as well. You can view your feed, like and comment on posts, and send and receive direct messages like other social media platforms. There is an easy way to ‘like’ someone’s post, by simply double tapping their content. Everyone can see the likes they got from their followers, unless you have the privacy setting turned as “private” or “visible to me only”. With the privacy setting, you can manage if you want your followers to see who liked your post or not. Generally, depending on the amount of followers an Instagram account has, the less the followers, the more likely you get responded by the creators if you comment on their posts. However, even for an Instagram official account that has more than 10 million followers, your comments can still get responded to, it’s rare, though.
 
Educators use Instagram as a more straightforward way to teach compared to other platforms. Educators use graphics, images, videos to support text in a clear and simple way to the learners and people who are interested with the topic. The content educators teach can vary quite a lot, from academic education to practical education, due to the openness and freedom people have on Instagram. It means that people can learn materials on Instagram that would help them succeed in university, as well as in life. The audience could be anyone who has an Instagram account, and usually people tend to follow Instagram accounts that match their areas of interests. Educators on Instagram typically are open to respond to questions, especially when good questions are asked. Some educators use Instagram as a PLN, which they also learn, share materials with other people whereas some educators only use Instagram for creating content.
 
For Instagram, it’s extremely important to gain as many followers as possible if you want your posts to get some views. In our learning pod, each of us created a new account for Instagram and we posted some short educational posts to see how people would react to it. However, this is not how Instagram works, none of us received a comment by someone. Therefore, Instagram is best used when you already have some reputation in your education career and suggest your learners to follow your Instagram account for more interesting content. So, people respond to the same post similarly if the creator of the post is reputed and authoritative.

Educators should always be aware of negative things such as offensive and inappropriate content on any social media platform. There are countless cases of people getting insulted, humiliated while using Instagram. Educators should focus on things they can have control of, and avoid creating posts that consist of racist messages, for instance. Instagram has a powerful feature that can help protect people when they experience a rush of abusive comments and DMs. The feature is called Limits, that is easy to turn on, and will automatically hide comments and DM requests from people who don’t follow you, or who only recently followed you.

As the Internet makes the educational process more interesting than ever, educators should keep themselves up to date with the cool features of social media platforms and get the most out of it. Instagram can become a great educational tool that makes the educational process unique, interesting, and insightful. For example, in teaching, instead of having a physical file of a portfolio, educators can encourage students to create a digital portfolio, or e-portfolio, on Instagram. A cool benefit for learners to use Instagram for learning is that Instagram helps build interpersonal skills. Interpersonal skills are a key element to ensure healthy personal and professional lives. With Instagram’s cool feature of sharing personal stories and interests with others, teachers can encourage students to engage with their peers in Instagram, and form groups on the platform. Instagram is a cool addition to class even for a traditional classroom.
