## Demographics {-}

### Target Audience {-}
YouTube’s target audience is people of all ages. YouTube has created a “YouTube Kids”, so even young children have to ability to watch videos with their parents being comfortable because the videos on YouTube Kids are appropriate for young children. The gender demographics of YouTube is split very evenly, with a report demonstrating that 45.8% of YouTube’s total advertising audience is female, and 54.2% of YouTube’s total advertising audience is female ^[[Needle, F. (2021). YouTube Demographics & Data to Know in 2021 [+What Different Generations Watch on the Platform]](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/youtube-demographics)]. This information is collected from those who report themselves or have their gender shown on their YouTube account. Furthermore, YouTube has launched local versions of the platform in over 100 countries—this demonstrates that YouTube is used worldwide. People use YouTube for many different reasons, some of these reasons are tutorial videos, entertainment, education, mindfulness, to share personal videos, and so on! 

### Searching Content {-}
On YouTube you do not need to have an account to search the content and browse videos. There are some extra features though if you do have a YouTube account. Some of these features include, uploading your own videos, liking videos, subscribing to certain accounts, commenting on videos, more ability to control your privacy, watching videos in incognito mode, and you can create and share playlists. 

### How Users are Connected {-}
You can connect to millions of people on YouTube. The main way people connect is by subscribing to one another. This means that when they post a video it will show up in your “subscription” section. Furthermore, you can comment on and like peoples videos. 

### Content {-}
Content can be uploaded on YouTube in a variety of ways. Videos can be uploaded publicly for everyone to see, but they also can be uploaded privately. Content creators on YouTube get to choose the audience who can see their videos. If a person wants a video to be uploaded but only available for themself to watch, they can upload it privately. There is also a feature on YouTube where you can upload a video but only the people you share the link with can watch the video. 

Any video can be shared through a link. If the video is public and you have access to the link you can share it on your other social media accounts which can help the video gain attraction. Videos go viral by getting a lot of views. If your YouTube account already has a lot of subscribers, it is more likely for your video to go viral, but it is very possible to go viral without having a lot of subscribers. If the video posted is interesting, trendy, and the right people see and share it, it will go viral.

### Revenue {-}
There are a few ways that YouTube makes money. The first is through advertising. There are advertisements on YouTube's home page and throughout most of the videos on the site. YouTube also has a monthly subscription service called “YouTube Premium”, which gives them revenue as well. YouTube also developed tools to help eligible creators earn money in a variety of other ways, such as [Super Chat](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7288782), [channel memberships](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7636690) and [merchandise](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9158148). In most cases, creators and YouTube share revenue generated from these channels.

## Balancing your PLN and Public Discourse {-}

### High-Profile Individuals and Social Media {-}
High-profile individuals and their use of social media highly varies with their intent, and more broadly, their ‘branding’. In general, these people are highly looked up to. ‘Branding’, in this case, refers to a person’s reputation composed of unique skills and personality that has the ability to influence a mass of individuals ^[[What is personal branding?](https://www.digitalmarketing.org/blog/what-is-personal-branding)]. High-profile people attract a significant amount of attention online, on television, and so on. These individuals tend to have a big following and are generally scrutinized by the public eye more than the average person. This includes celebrities, musicians, politicians, etc.—depending on the individual’s intent, their platform can be utilized however they see fit, including the good and the bad.

For example, there are celebrities such as [Ryan Reynolds](https://www.youtube.com/c/VancityReynolds) who utilizes his youtube channel to share lighthearted, and fun-loving videos as a form of entertainment. Despite the majority of his videos being published for movie promotions, his way of sharing online information is harmless and full of cheeky humor for everyone to enjoy. In other cases, there are politicians such as [Justin Trudeau](https://www.youtube.com/c/pmcanada) who upload daily youtube videos primarily showcasing crucial remarks on Canada’s political landscape. Through his videos, any individual around the globe who has access to the internet can be filled in on current events and strike up discussion as needed. These are a couple of notable benefits when it comes to being in the public eye and having a PLN, however, it’s important to recognize that at the cost of consuming information, users and educators are also at risk of misinformation.

### Minimizing Misinformation {-}
The best way in spotting and avoiding false information on platforms such as Youtube is to build a sense of awareness and be skeptical of the content that’s being shared or received. According to an article by [The Conversation](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/business/misinformation-social-media-how-to-avoid-spreading), this means taking the following actions:

* Educate yourself - Individuals can be easily manipulated by specific tricks of misinformation. It’s best to conduct your own research and understand how these techniques are being used against you—as a result, you develop a critical eye and become less susceptible to manipulation.
* Recognise your vulnerabilities - Biases can easily sway us. Tread carefully when critical information heavily aligns with your values and what you think is right. It’s just as important to consider other perspectives.
* Consider the source - Be cautious of where the information is coming from. Academic articles that have been peer-reviewed are one of the most credible sources out there, whereas a news article that is not backed by a confirmed expert may not be the most trustworthy source of information.
* Take a pause - When coming across information for the first time, do not believe what you read instantly. Take time to reflect and ask: “Is this information reasonable? Why or why not?”. Explore the content and dig deeper beyond those words.
* Be aware of your emotions - Stay rational! Don’t let your feelings lead you to impulsive behavior that would instigate consuming misinformation
* If you see something, say something - Be proactive in taking action against misinformation. Protect yourself and others by simply pointing out falsified statements rather than doing nothing. 

Ultimately, there is no clear solution in minimizing misinformation. However, what truly matters is the effort put into rationally criticizing what we consume online for the sake of ourselves and for others.  


## Social Media and PLN in Education {-}

### Platform Utilization & Platform Interaction {-}
Educators, or creators, are able to use Youtube to strike up interesting discussions as well as share knowledge for the desired targeted niche. They may do so by uploading videos to their created profile, or ‘youtube channel’, in which users will be able to access and view their videos at the time of convenience. The types of videos uploaded will depend on the target audience of the educator. For example, [The Organic Chemistry Tutor](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheOrganicChemistryTutor/featured) uploads tutorial videos on organic chemistry, general chemistry, physics, algebra, trigonometry, precalculus, and calculus—his primary audience, in turn, consists of users related to these subjects, most of which are high school students. In other cases, there are educators such as Michelle Emerson’s [“Pocketful of Primary”](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf4ktrnK_jWG1mC7U7fNphA) who help fellow teachers lead a healthy teaching lifestyle by sharing ideas on classroom management, lesson planning, and building student relationships. The possibilities are endless and ultimately, it is up to the educator to determine the content they would like to publish. 

Youtube can be utilized as a personal learning network. Besides creating content, Youtube can help foster connections, maintain connections with relevant groups, and also allow for new learning. Each educator will have a unique following, where he or she will be able to interact with their community through a variety of methods. The most common form of interaction are comments—should educators feel the need to respond to a user, they are free to leave a comment. The following are a few other methods of how people interact on Youtube:

**1. Comments**

**3. Community Posts**

### Platform Concerns (Privacy, Age-inappropriate Content, Disinformation, etc.) {-}
Educators should be careful of distracting, harmful, and inaccurate videos that are published worldwide across the platform. Youtube’s content is generally not well-vetted, meaning that there is no requirement for published information to be accurate or truthful. In other words, creators and users do not have restrictions on what’s being said or shown through comments or videos ^[[Youtube is major conduit of fake news, factcheckers say](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/12/youtube-is-major-conduit-of-fake-news-factcheckers-say)]. As a result, viewers can easily fall prey to misinformation and disinformation. Violent or sexual content can also be a significant concern. Despite Youtube’s community guidelines, sensitive content still tends to get past regulations.

Fortunately, the platform has resources which enforces reporting and filtering of content such as the following:
