## Demographics {-} 

### Target Audience and Users {-}

 Tik Tok is available in over 150 countries, storing the information of over 1 billion users. The widespread population of users has approximately 120 million users residing in the United States, 87 million from Indonesia and 72 million in Brazil. Surprisingly, Canada does not currently make the shortlist of countries (top 10), that hold the greatest number of users. Owed to the increase of technological advancement, it is evident why the main demographic of consumers is what is commonly referred to as the “Gen Z”. A totalled 60% of users match Gen Z’s age group (individuals born between the years of 1997-2012) with a majority aged between 10-25. With that being said, it should be noted that TikTok requires its users to meet the minimum age requirement of 13 years old. 
 An older demographic of seniors can be seen on this app too, though they constitute an unusual subset. Similar success has been recorded of older generations, with great traction and activity on their platforms. To name a few, @oldgays is a group of older men that share their thoughts and opinions on life, and @cookingwithLynja shares insight on how to make yummy meals in a quick and easy fashion. 
 In comparing the gender of TikTok’s users, there is an obvious breakdown of genders and their active use on the app. To date, identified females make up the majority of users with a remainder of male users (39%) and others (2%) constituting the rest. TikTok targets individuals with interests and hobbies of all sorts. Promising a guarantee for users to be matched with creators that align with their hobbies and interests, running from fashion to baking, dance and/ or travel. 
 Tiktok has enabled users to create business accounts to allow for easy, accessible and reviewal of the accounts analytics. Businesses in particular have greatly utilized the analytics page to pinpoint the age, gender, and likes of their active users. The information received from the analytics, successfully supplies and equips companies with the proper tools to adapt and  progress. 

#### Non-users {-}

TikTok does not require users to create an account to browse the platform. There are a variety of methods that allow non-users to navigte the platform. With a few simple steps, users that do not wish make an account are able to view the content. 
The first option consists of following three simple steps:
1. Go to TikTok.com
2. Select “For you” on the left sidebar 
3. Begin watching videos without logging into an account

Videos made and created on TikTok’s platform can also be viewed on other neighbouring media platforms. Multiple channels on youtube have dedicated their content to uploading what is currently trending on Tik Tok. Content creators of youtube make it possible for users without an account to gain quick and easy access to like and comment on the video on youtube. 
TikTok videos may also be viewed without an account if they’re sent by message, Snapchat, email, Facebook etc. 
With that being said, there are a variety of features that can not be accessed if you do not have an account. Without an account, you are unable to follow creators, like videos, see or write comments on the videos, upload or share content or join creators ‘lives’.

#### How Users are Connected {-}

Tik Tok users are connected by following other users and content creators. Any creator you wish to see, you can simply go onto their account and click to follow them. Unless they have a private account, they do not have to accept your follow request in order for you to see their content. Whoever you follow also does not have to follow you back, you may still access and see their content even if there is not a mutual following. On Tik Tok, there are two types of pages you can look at to see videos. The ‘for you page’ showcases viral Tik Toks and creators of all sorts. From the for you page, you may discover creators who you wish to connect with and follow. Once you have followed people, their Tik Toks may show up on a separate browsing page. When you go onto the Tik Tok app, there are two sections of videos you can browse, those who you follow who will appear on the ‘following’ page, while other creators will appear on the for you page. All of the creators you follow will appear on the following page as a means to make sure the videos of the people you follow are not lost amongst the for you page. You may also connect with other Tik Tok users by ‘lives’. Users may choose to go live and show what they are doing, answer questions or just hang out with their followers on a live stream. Creators may also go live with other creators. On lives, users can comment and ask questions in real-time in order to connect with other creators. 

### Content {-}

#### Content Sharing {-}

TikTok users can share a video by clicking on the share button and choosing to copy the link or share it on another social media platform such as Snapchat, Facebook messenger, and Instagram.

#### Privately Sharing Content {-}

When a user initially creates a TikTok account, the videos and comments are set to public. This means any TikTok user can access the content and follow the account. However, TikTok has Privacy settings that allow the account to be changed to private. When the account is set to private, the account holder can approve or deny follow requests and only the approved followers can view the content. 

Even if the account is set to public, the account holder may edit the privacy settings on individual videos. This includes allowing everyone to view the video, only the followers that you follow back to view the video, or only the account holder can view the video.

#### Viral Content {-} 

When a user creates and uploads a public video on TikTok, it is shared onto the user’s profile. 
If the content a user creates gets picked up by the TikTok algorithm, it will share the user’s video onto the “For You” page. Based on the user's interests and past interactions with TikTok videos, TikTok's algorithm curates a "For You" page of video content from creators the user may not follow. The algorithm utilizes users’ data on interactions with videos such as the screen time of watching a video, liking the video, and/or sharing it.

Content goes viral when it makes it onto the “For You” page. As a video gets more comments, likes, shares, and duets, the greater its chances of being picked up by the algorithm. The completion rate of your videos is an additional factor that influences ranking. In general, the more viewers watch a TikTok video to the end, the more likely it is to be shared.

#### Educators on TikTik {-}

Educators use Tik Tik as a platform to reach audience members from all over the world. Tik Tok provides a platform for creators to share their voices and knowledge. Videos are created with the intent to educate viewers, answer questions and promote learning. All types of content are currently being taught on TikTok. You are able to find educators such as @Dad, how do I? who is a father educating viewers on how to fix things, and providing life lessons for those who may not have their own Dad to teach them. You can also access content such as @Janelle Rohner who educates her viewers on Keto lifestyles and provides weight loss tips and Keto recipes. Depending on the type of content they are producing determines the type of audience members. For instance, @Dad, how do I? Has an audience of mostly young people while @Janelle Rohner’s audience is an older audience as some of the content she shares is keto drinks for those 19+. No matter what type of topic you are looking to be educated on, you are sure to find someone on Tik Tok who is producing content to educate you on that particular topic. 

#### Educators Responses to Comments and Questions {-}

Creators constantly are responding to and addressing questions. A vast majority of the videos they create are addressing comments or questions. When a question has been asked, educators may produce a video that shows the question being asked and them addressing it. This way, they can directly address the comments and/or questions of their viewers.  

#### TikTok as a PLN {-}

Educators on Tik Tok are able to use the platform as a PLN, for instance on Tik Tok you are sure to find teachers who are sharing and posting free resources they currently use or have found such as their favourite worksheets or learning activities. Tik Tok is much like a virtual team with which you can share and swap ideas with. Tik Tok can be used by teachers to expand their personal learning networks. Creators do much more than just creating content.

### Concerns with TikTok {-}

As with any social media platform, educators should be aware of the age-inappropriate content that can be accessed on the app. The most obvious sources of adult content on TikTok are profanity and suggestive clothing. Although the minimum age for a TikTok user is 13 years old, the app does not use any age verification tools when users are creating an account. With the ability to search any hashtag or key words in the app, users can access any content created by another user. Although TikTok has strict guidelines on nudity and graphic content, since any user can upload their opinions on any topic, offensive content may be shared on the app. Due to the nature of the social media app, when a video becomes viral millions of people can be impacted by ampliganda. According to DiRestas, amplignda is the new word for misinformation in the digital age. On TikTok, any user can now shape perceptions and realities by having their ideology amplified through shares, likes, and comments of a mass audience.
